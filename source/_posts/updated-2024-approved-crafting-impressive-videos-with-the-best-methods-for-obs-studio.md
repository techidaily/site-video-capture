## 2\. Blender

Movavi Video Editor Plus is a good solution if you require a video editing program for dynamic films, such as sports footage, music videos, and fast-paced movies in general.

It allows users to use text to adjust both audio and video.

This application is perfect for short video creations. Its creators advocate a three-step procedure: Record your screen then add a couple of the effects and share.

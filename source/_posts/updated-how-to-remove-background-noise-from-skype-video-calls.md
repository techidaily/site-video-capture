## Part 2: How to Remove Background Noise After a Recording Was Done

Now we know how to get rid of noise before a Skype video call, but what about the video that has already been recorded? How is it possible to remove the background noise and improve the voice quality?

Well don’t worry, the quality of these ‘already recorded videos’ can be improved by using applications like Filmora. There are a variety of applications that can do this function but we prefer Filmora because of its easy to use interface and amazing results.

So here we are going to show you how to remove background noise after a recording was already done by using its Denoise feature.

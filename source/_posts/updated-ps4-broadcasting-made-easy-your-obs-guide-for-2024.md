## 2\. OBS Alternative To Record Gameplay

Besides, many users have reported that OBS crashes when they start to record video games with PS4 connected. Moreover, OBS is not suitable for capturing high-end games as well as for low-configuration system as it requires heavy CPU resource.

As an alternative PS4 OBS is [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You will find many popular video creators using Filmora to [record screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), gameplay, webcam overlay.

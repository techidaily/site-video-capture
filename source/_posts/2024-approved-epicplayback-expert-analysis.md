Individual hotkeys are included, allowing you to explore your game without being interrupted. It also allows you to capture videos in 4K at 120 frames per second, which is rather impressive for a gadget of this sort. Add sound from speakers and a mouthpiece to your interaction accounts, as well as webcam video, so you can share your emotions with viewers when you upload the video to YouTube or another video-sharing platform.

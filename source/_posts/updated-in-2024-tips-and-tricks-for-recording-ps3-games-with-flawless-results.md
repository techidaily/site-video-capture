## The Bottom Line

Even though PlayStation 3 is not the latest gaming console and there is no built-in screen recorder like PS4 and PS5, you can still record your gameplay and upload on social media and video streaming platforms. The best way is to buy a capture card and use Filmora to record PS3 gameplay flawlessly. You can edit the recorded video and make it more interesting to get positive feedback from online viewers.

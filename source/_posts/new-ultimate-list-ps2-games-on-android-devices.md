You'll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app's folder.

Around 30 is the typical best ps2 emulator android gaming pace. A 0 to 20 fps Android phone game is almost unplayable, 21 to 29 fps is acceptable, and 30 fps and beyond is nearly as enjoyable as playing on a console.

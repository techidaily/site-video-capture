## Conclusion

Recording a live stream video conference call or corporate meeting is no more an issue. You can use online screen recorder Screencast-O-Matic or Google extension Screencastify. If you are hosting the live stream session yourself through Dacast or Restream, we will illustrate how you can use the platforms to record your live sessions. But the best way to record any live stream video is by using Wondershare Filmora.

![record pc screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-01.png)

Step 2: Choose the recording screen area which should be the same or greater than the live stream conference software area. Select the system audio to record everyone speaking.

If you want to add your voice, select external the mic audio source. If you want to capture your webcam video along with your screen, enable “Record Camera Stream” option.

![recording audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-04.png)

![export the project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-the-project.jpg)

## Way 2\. Use Dacast

Dacast is an extremely popular platform for organizing live stream conference and meeting. Apart from live streaming, you can host your video on the platform as well as monetize your video to earn revenue. Most importantly, you can record your live stream video conference so that the audiences can re-watch them at any future instance. You can record video up to six hours at a time. Here are the steps to record your live stream video on Dacast.

Step 1: Create a live channel on Dacast and set the following settings so that recording works perfectly.

Video Codex –

Audio Codec – ACC

Live Channel Status - On

Step 2: Go to General section and turn on Live Stream Recording option. Once you turn it on, the recording will be automatic in the background once you start live streaming your video.

![decast live channel status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/decast-live-channel-status.jpg)

The recording option stays activated for seven days. Thereafter, you have to activate it again from General section.

Step 3: The recording will stop automatically as soon as you stop your live stream. If you want to stop recording in between, you have to disable the recording option and save VOD file. You can find the recorded video under “Video on Demand” option.

It is important to note that you can record Dacast live stream video only if you are the creator of the video. It is not possible for a viewer to record with Dacast and the viewer needs to use a dedicated screen recorder.

Restream is another popular live streaming platform and you can live stream your video on almost all the popular online live streaming websites. If you are using Restream to live stream video, you can record your video as well. First of all, Restream Studio automatically records your live stream videos as soon as you go live.

When your live stream gets over, you will get to download in your hard drive as well as export the recording to cloud storage platforms. Apart from that, there is a Record-only Mode that also lets you record your video on Restream. Here are the steps to follow.

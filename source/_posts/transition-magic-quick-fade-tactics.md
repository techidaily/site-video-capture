### 1\. Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage

The first way to fade in and fade out the footage in Filmora is by applying dissolve transition. The dissolve, also called lap dissolve sometimes, is a gradual transition from one image to another. It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.

So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.

Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.

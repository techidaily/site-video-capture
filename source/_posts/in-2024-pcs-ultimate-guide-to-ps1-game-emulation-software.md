### 4.ePSXe

![epsxe-ps1-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/epsxe-ps1-poster.png)

You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program. It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.

Gameplay usually runs smoothly without much configuration and trial-and-error. When your game doesn't load or you experience lags, you can fix it by applying an ePSXe patch (in .ppf format).

**Features:**

* This software provides a close analogous experience to playing video games on the PlayStation One itself, but on a personal computer.
* Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.
* It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.
* Dual-player and split-screen modes are available. Additionally, you can also use external gamepads to play your favorite video games.

### 5.Biz Hawk

With a debugging system like this, you can analyze emulation down to the millimeter and beat time records or high scores by making the most of your video game emulation.

**Features:**

* Support for full-screen mode
* Fire controls that operate automatically or quickly
* There are an infinite number of named savestates
* Stepping, rewinding, and speed control.

Finally, there's a Windows snipping application called FastStone, which is really fairly comparable to ShareX in terms of functionality. It is the best screenshot app for windows. You may also record videos with this trustworthy tool.

It has a free trial version that lasts for 30 days. Portable versions of FastStone are also available, which you may use on a USB drive.

When using this software, you'll be able to take screenshots of your current window as well as any other area of the screen that you choose.

**Features:**

* You may share your work with social networks you like, and you can even copy the output to the web directly.
* As well as email, Word, Excel, and the clipboard, it may also be used with other programs.
* It can also handle a variety of file types, including PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP.
* Additionally, it provides convenient features like cropping, resizing, rotating and changing the color of the image.
* A black & white filter effect may also be applied to the photographs.

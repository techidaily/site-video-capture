## How to Record Video on HP Chromebooks?

[Chromebook](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) have become increasingly popular over recent years. Google’s low-cost laptops have even come to dominate the education market in the US. Unfortunately, Chromebooks do not come with a pre-installed application for recording or streaming video. If you are using an HP Chromebook and want to record video you must visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/unsupported) and download a screen recording app. Now, here are a lot of potential apps to choose from. However, we recommend using [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen%5Frecorder).

Screencast-O-Matic is the ideal combination of ease-of-use and powerful editing tools. You can make an unlimited number of recordings for no charge. Videos can also be published to YouTube or uploaded to Google Drive directly from the recorder.

The following is a breakdown of how to record video on HP Chromebooks using Screencast-O-Matic:

#### 1. Launch Screencast-O-Matic

Download the app in the Chrome Web Store and then launch the application by double-clicking on the Screen-O-Matic icon. Getting started is easy, just click the **Start Recording** button to go to the screen recorder page.

#### 2. Adjust Settings

When the recorder opens there will be a black and white frame with a prominent taskbar. Using the options at the top of the taskbar you can choose to record your screen, webcam or both your screen and webcam. You can click the **Size** button to choose from standard HD sizes. Or, you can drag and resize the frame manually to create custom sizes.

By default, the recorder will use your laptop’s built-in microphone. Click the **Narration** button to change your default microphone options.

#### 3.Record Webcam Videos

When you are ready, click the red **Record** button to record all the action within the frame. You can then pause, resume and preview the recording using the options below the frame. To finish the recording click the **Done** button.

After you have clicked the **Done** button, a new window will appear. Here you can choose to either save the recording as a video file or upload it to Screencast-O-Matic.com or YouTube.

Screencast-O-Matic have [a selection of other tutorials which can be accessed here](http://help.screencast-o-matic.com/). For $1.50 a month you can also upgrade to their Pro Recorder. With the Pro Recorder, you unlock unlimited recording time per video, enhanced editing capabilities, specialised mouse tracking and further uploading options, including Vimeo and Dropbox.

Quite recently, Microsoft integrated a new feature to the Teams app that allows the organizers to automatically record all the meeting sessions that take place.

You can learn **how to record a Teams meeting** automatically by following the instructions that are given below:

Launch Microsoft Teams on your computer, and use the method explained earlier to get to the **Meeting with** box by initiating a new meeting.

**Step 3: Enable Automatic Recording**

On the **Meeting options** page, turn on the **Record automatically** switch. Once this is done, you can safely share the invitation link with the people you want to attend the meeting, and Teams will start the recording as soon as the first participant joins in.

## Part 3: How to Find Recorded Meetings in Teams?

One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare. Although Wondershare Filmora is primarily used for industry-standard post-product tasks such as video editing, apply effects and filters to the motion clips, etc., it offers the option to [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam, and audio as additional features so you don’t have to depend on any other software for screencasting.

However, a minimum HD resolution is a must. A good screen recorder offers Full HD recording, while some offer 2K and 4K recording.

Therefore, go for a screen recorder with audio online and webcam capture.

Besides, customizing the settings should be easy, and the download option should be readily available. In addition, some screen recorders come with a basic video editor, which is an add-on.

Both OBS and Bandicam have very limited features in editing a video when editing is essential after you record a video. This is where Filmora scores over OBS and Bandicam. You can capture the screen, record video from webcam as well as record audio from different sources.

It is a professional video editor with loads of options to edit your recorded video and make it crisp and eye-catching. Therefore, it is a value for money product, and that is why Filmora is one of the most preferred applications among beginners and professionals. Here are the steps to record the screen with Filmora.

Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora. It is available for Windows and Mac. Open Filmora and click on PC Screen option.

## Conclusion

Bandicam has more options for better screen recording but it lacks useful editing options. If you are looking for a better alternative Bandicam, we recommend Wondershare Filmora and you can record and edit video like a professional.

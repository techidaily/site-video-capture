 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

In the age of the global pandemic that was caused by COVID-19, social distancing is one of the best ways to prevent this infamous disease from spreading. [Video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allow us to keep in touch with our friends and family during these difficult times without jeopardizing anyone’s safety. Mac, iPhone, or iPad users don’t have to think much about which video chat app they are going to choose as FaceTime is both free and easy to use.

Android operating systems don’t come with FaceTime’s equivalent, which is the reason why their users have to find a video chat app that best suits their needs. So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best free FaceTime for Android alternatives.

## The Ten Best Free Video Chat Alternatives to FaceTime on Android

Even though your friends who have iPhones cannot chat with you through FaceTime, there are still lots of video chat apps that are compatible with both iOS and Android operating systems.

The best part is that you don’t have to spend a single cent to be able to communicate with a friend who has an iPhone from your Android device. Here are the ten best free video chat alternatives to FaceTime on Android.

Even though Google Duo was launched just three years ago, it is easily one of the best alternatives to FaceTime, as you can use this app on both iPhone and Android phones or from a web browser. The app’s been labeled as Android’s official response to FaceTime, as it allows its users to receive calls even if they don’t have it installed on their phones.

Google Duo allows you to organize group calls with up to **12 participants**  or send video, audio or text messages. Sharing photos or making voice calls through Google Duo are also some of the options you will have if you decide to use this video chat app.

With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.

**Conclusion**

Finding the alternative to FaceTime won’t take too long, as there are so many different video chat apps you can use to organize conference calls or group chats.

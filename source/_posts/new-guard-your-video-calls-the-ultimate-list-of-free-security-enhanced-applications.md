So, chatting with friends, families, and colleagues has now become easier.

 Suppose you are busy at the moment, and cannot accept a video call request. Just send a custom message along with fun effects through the video messaging tool.

* Voice Calling

 There are times when a video call is not possible. Don’t worry because Google Duo also supports voice-only calls.

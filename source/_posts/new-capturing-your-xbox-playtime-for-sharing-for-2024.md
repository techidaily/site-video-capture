## Way 2\. Use A Recorder with Capture Card

When you use Xbox One directly to record your gameplay, you can record only for a limited time based on the available storage space. Besides, you have to transfer the recorded video to your computer for editing and uploading on various online platforms. Therefore, it is better that you capture your gameplay on your computer and you will need a capture card for high-quality recording. A capture card is necessary for connecting a computer with a gaming console. Once you buy a compatible capture card, here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Connect Xbox One, capture card and your computer through HDMI cable.

Step 2: Connect Xbox One to your TV and connect capture card to your computer through USB or data cable.

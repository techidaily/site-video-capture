![record patch folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-path-folder6.jpg)

**Step 3: Change the recording path**

If you want to change the recording destination then click on the path and choose the folder where you want to save the recordings.

However, the recordings are kept in the user application folder by default as this path is recommended by Microsoft. If by mistake you have selected a different path then you can restore it to default by clicking on **Restore default folder settings** located on the right side of your recorder folder.

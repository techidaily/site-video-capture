## Mastering MOV to MPEG-4 Conversion on Win 11

MOV is an extremely popular video file format that is commonly used in shooting high-quality videos. MOV file format is developed by Apple, and hence, it is the default video file format on Mac. However, you can play MOV files on Windows PC by installing QuickTime. In fact, you can use Windows Media Player 12 as well as VLC Media Player to play MOV files. But the question arises how to record MOV files on Windows 10.

Record videos from webcam:

Also, click the "Record" option, and choose "Record from Webcam". In the pop-up Video Recording window, click the red button to start recording and click it again to stop recording. Then click OK to save the recorded video file.

Record voice-over: Choose "Record a voiceover" under the Record menu. It would be better to connect a microphone to your Mac for a better result. Hit the Record button, and it leaves you 3 seconds to get ready.

All the recorded media files will be saved into Media Library automatically and you can drag them to the Timeline for editing.

## Conclusion

EaseUS RecExpert is an easy-to-use and powerful screen recording software for anyone on Windows or Mac. With a super intuitive interface and multiple screen capture options, it makes screen recording a piece of cake. With this software, users can record video and audio.

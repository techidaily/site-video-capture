### 3\. Can you screen record a timelapse iPad?

Firstly, it is possible to record a timelapse on an iPad. With the help of the time-lapse option, the camera can capture various pictures at the selected time interval. Later on, a video is generated using all the captured images. The report says that the time-lapse feature is only available on iOS 8 or higher.

## The Bottom Line

We have gathered knowledge about the five best timelapse screen recorders. You can consider downloading them as they are the best in every aspect. Every app has different output, so you must check which application is suitable for you.

You can also use a few third-party applications to add a spark of professionalism to your work. These apps are very friendly and helpful, so I prefer downloading them. All the mentioned applications are available on all the platforms so that you can time lapse your video anywhere.

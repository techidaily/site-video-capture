But for the sake of carrying important information to all the users out there looking for information regarding screen recorders then we serve our purpose for them. Here in this article, the aim was to provide the simplest application and ways to record your screen with great ease. We started with pretty much basic screen recording shortcuts and basic applications to screen record your Mac. We greatly hope after reading this article it will be never a problem for you to screen record anytime using your MacBook Air.

Part 2: Use QuickTime Player

Another hidden application in your MacBook Air utility program that already comes built-in with Mac OS is QuickTime Player. With this player, you can easily record your screen and take screenshots along the system audio as well as microphone input. To access this application and utilize it for your purpose all you need is to follow the steps given in the coming section.

First, you will need to look into your applications row on your desktop screen. You will probably see the QuickTime player icon there. Right-click on the icon and start the new screen recorder to access the application. Or you can use the other method to access it with QuickTime open from the upper bar as shown in the figure below.

![quicktime player row on desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-player-row-on-desktop-screen.jpg)

Once you are done with launching the GUI of the application, it's time to learn how can you start recording now. Before starting your recording with the red icon of the start button as shown it is important to choose whether you want microphone input to be recorded or not. You can easily do it by enabling the internal microphone in the settings as shown in the figure. Once you are done with the settings it's time to start your recording.

![quciktime internal microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quciktime-internal-microphone.jpg)

Click on the start recording button and you will see a new window will pop up to choose the screen recording mode from it as shown in the figure below. To record in the full-screen recording mode you just need to click randomly on the screen once and it will start recording the whole screen. Otherwise, drag and select a particular area on the screen and click start recording once shown and you will have the recording of the particular screen area.

After following the above steps, you will see the Filmora recorder has been launched as shown. You can select different capturing modes for your screen recording using the “Full Screen” options. Moreover, the frame size of your capturing can also be adjusted using custom values for size. Choose microphone input for your video through mic settings and enable/disable system audio anytime in this window. The recording can be started with the circular icon on this window as shown in the figure.

Before starting your recording it's important to have a look at the detailed recording settings. To access those settings just click on the settings icon on the GUI of the recorder as can be seen in the above picture. Once you have clicked on it, you will see a new window of settings as shown.

![set audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-for-mac-2.png)

You can choose the destination folder for your recording from the “Save To” filed in the newly launched window. You can also set frame rates, and the quality of your video and start the recorder timer before starting recording. If you want to record the webcam footage or some other camera module attached to your PC too. All you need to check the Camera field and it will simultaneously record your camera feed too.

Soon as you start capturing your screen recording, you will a timer will start the countdown. Once it's finished, your recording will be started. After some time you think, it's time to finish recording then you don’t have to worry about that too. All you have to do is by clicking the small icon in the top-right icon bar of the desktop screen of your MacBook Air as shown in the picture below attached.

This is how you can record your screen with an amazing recorder that comes with the WonderShare Filmora application on your MacBook Air.

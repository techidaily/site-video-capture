## Evaluating Fraps as a Screen Grab Pro

If you like to record video games, Fraps can help you take your YouTube channel to new heights. Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.

Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It's also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can't add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.

## 1\. Download and Install

Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program's full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps' general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.

## 2\. How to Record Screen with Fraps

****Step 1:** When you first launch Fraps, you'll see that there isn't much to it. There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.

![fraps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg)

****Step 2:** Fraps' benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS > Benchmark Settings to your desire.

![fps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg)

****Step 3:** Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest "X" seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.

## 3\. Pros and Cons

The number of frames per second (FPS) may be seen in the corner of the screen by users. After a picture is acquired, the platform automatically names and timestamps it. It also includes features for video files such as movie cursor hiding, stereoscopic 3D, and RGB capturing.

**Cons:**

* Your computer screen, webcam, or face cam cannot be recorded.
* The Microsoft Store does not enable you to record DirectX 12 or Windows games.
* It is not possible to record the computer screen or webcam.
* You can't post a captured video to YouTube or Vimeo using it.

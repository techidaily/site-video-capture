## Part 3: How to Add Your Own Background to Google Meet On Computer and Mobile?

As outlined earlier, individuals can easily add their own custom backgrounds on Google Meet and apply those backgrounds during their meetings. The process is very simple. All you need to do is follow the same steps indicated above. Once you get to the “Change Background” option or “Effects” option click on that and then press the “Add” icon.

![add image as Google Meet background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-as-google-meet-video-background.jpg)

You may also upload multiple custom backgrounds on your mobile and laptop devices.

## Part 4: How to Change Your Background On Google Meet On Android/iOS Before Meeting?

To change the background in Google Meet on Android or iOS, you need to have Android / iOS devices which support the feature; the devices are listed below.

Some Android devices which work exceptionally well with Google Meet backgrounds include the Samsung Galaxy S9, Pixel 3, as well as other similar devices. On the split side, if you are an iOS user then opt for an iPhone 8 or latest version, an iPad 5th Generation or later, or any Apple device which has iOS 12 or above.

Tip: In some cases you might get cropped out due to your background, to avoid that, you will need to turn it off. Also, if your device has a low battery, you might want to turn your background off, to make your battery last longer.

Just as you are allowed to change your background on Google Meet on desktop, similarly you can change it on a mobile device. The process is fairly simple too. The steps outlined below are for Android as well as iOS.

1. Open the Google Meet application on your device. Before joining the meeting on your device click the “Effects” icon, you will find it near the bottom of your screen on self-view. With effects, you can alter the lighting during your call to create a more clear ambiance.
2. Don’t want to let your colleagues to where you are at and remain professional at the same time? Google Meet has got you covered! You can blur the background now! To use the pre-built backgrounds, tap the background you would like to use from the given options. There are numerous options ranging from professional workspaces to a beachside view!

![change Google Meet background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-background-google-meet.jpg)

1. To upload a background of your own choice, tap the “Add” button and you can add a completely new background! Select the photo you would like to use, then tap “Done”, and the image will automatically be adjusted to fit your device’s background.

![add Google Meet background on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-on-google-meet-mobile.jpg)

Voila! You are all set for your meeting beforehand, with the most optimal background change - based on need. Who knew Google Meet background change in mobile would be so simple!

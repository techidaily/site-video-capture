## Harness the Web to Preserve and Share Live Music Sounds

If you are a music and podcast lover, it is very likely that you often listen to streaming songs and podcasts online. There are surely going to be times when you wish you could download the streaming audio and save it on your hard drive for listening to them anytime offline.

In fact, you may want to record online live streams of podcasts before they disappear forever. That is where an online stream recorder can come in handy.

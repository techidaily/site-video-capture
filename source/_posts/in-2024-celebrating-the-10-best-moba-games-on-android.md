![arena-of-valor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/arena-of-valor.jpg)

Compared to other MOBAs, Arena of Valor is relatively new. The game offers a lot of unique features. It includes five versus five, three versus three, and one versus one game modes. Furthermore, the game includes over three dozen heroes, ten-minute matches, and cooperative multiplayer. It was released around the same time the Razer Phone came out and quickly gained popularity. Some users have complained about the Facebook login. Apart from that, there haven't been many complaints about the game. Some heroes can be purchased through in-app purchases, as with most MOBAs.

**Features:**

• Plenty of Heros to Play With

• Fast and Fun Gameplay

• Frequent updates are making the game better day by day

![mobilie-legend-bang-bang](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobilie-legend-bang-bang.jpg)

The oldest mobile MOBA, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, was released in 2010\. The game is also the most popular from a download perspective. The game offers simple controls, five-vs-five battles, and ten-minute matches. There are ten-second matchmaking wait times according to the Google Play description. That seems exaggerated. Other than that, the game is great. Disconnected players may rejoin the same battle at any time. We found that very cool. Overall, this is one of the top MOBA games out there.

**Features:**

• Huge Collection of heroes to play

• Quick Match Making: Mostly the match starts within a few minutes

• There are plenty of modes in the game where you can take part in a 5v5 battle

• The mobile controls are very responsive

### 3.League of Legends: Wild Rift

![lol-wild-rift](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lol-wild-rift.jpg)

Upon its arrival in the Google Play Store and App Store in 2020, Wild Rift became an instant hit as a long-awaited MOBA for mobile. A similar map to Summoner's Rift, a nearly identical set of champions, and challenging ranking mechanics make it a perfect successor to League of Legends. Although Wild Rift includes many features from the original, it also offers something new to players.

There is a lot of action in this game. Since the Nexus that protects the base turret has been removed, the game should last about 15-20 minutes, or even longer. This app has visually entertaining graphics with bright and crisp images optimized for mobile devices.

**Features:**

• Almost similar to its original version on Pc

• Eye-catching graphics and sounds

• Large Number of players worldwide

• 15-20 minutes games make it fun to play

![vainglogy-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vainglogy-poster.jpg)

A mobile version of Vainglory was released in 2015, and it quickly became one of the most popular MOBAs. More than 48 heroes are available in the game, which is a good number. Players can set matches to last seven minutes. Additionally, 25-minute matches are available for all-day slugfests. As for gameplay mechanics and responsiveness, Vainglory offers 60 frames per second gameplay and a 30-millisecond control response. Hardcore MOBA fans will find this quite satisfying.

It is the most popular MOBA on Android for a very good reason. It also has a low match waiting time due to its popularity. The game's cross-platform capabilities were unveiled in 2018\. This means it is now playable on PCs and Macs.

**Features:**

• Utilize playmaker heroes to outplay opponents with a unique adrenaline system that enables attack speed bonuses from accurate stutter steps

• Ability overdrive system allows selected maxed-out abilities to increase their bonuses

• Depending on a hero's build path and overdrives, multiple competitive playstyles are possible

The Onymoji series serves as the basis for NetEase's MOBA, Onmyoji Arena. This MOBA is very similar to other MOBAs, but with some differences. You can play triple battle royale, 3 vs 3 vs 3, which is fun and chaotic in this game.

A few AFK players have been reported and the game occasionally has loading problems, but overall, it is a positive experience. Over 55 unique hero characters based on Japanese folklore (such as Shuten and Ibaraki Doji) can be found in this game.

Two game modes are available in the game: 3v3 and Battle Royale. A three-man team fights against a third-man team like a traditional MOBA.

### 8.Brawl Stars

![brawl-stars-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/brawl-stars-poster.jpg)

Brawl Stars is a game that's made by the same people who made Clash of Clans, but that's lighter on the MOBA component. In spite of this, the core of the game is still the MOBA genre, which will appeal to casual players. The game itself has a lighter tone that is enjoyable to nearly everyone.

Two game modes are available in the game: 3v3 and Battle Royale. A three-man team fights against a third-man team like a traditional MOBA. The map only has one lane, similar to the Howling Abyss map from League of Legends, which leads to more brawling and fighting than strategic play. In Battle Royale mode, you are crammed into a small area, no loot is available, and only gunfire is needed to kill off your opponents.

**Features:**

• Various Brawlers with a variety of powerful Super abilities can be collected and upgraded

• Access skins for Brawlers

• Developed by the famous Scallop

• Earn Gems, pins, and an exclusive Brawl Pass skin by completing quests, opening Brawl Boxes, and earning Brawl Pass skins! Fresh content every season.

## **Final Verdict**

Here is our list of the 10 best MOBA games for android. Give these titles a try, and you will enjoy them a lot if you are a true MOBA lover. Although all games are based on the same concept, each one also has a unique perspective. They vary in a lot of things like graphics, heroes, gameplay, and skills, etc.

Compared to other MOBAs, Arena of Valor is relatively new. The game offers a lot of unique features. It includes five versus five, three versus three, and one versus one game modes. Furthermore, the game includes over three dozen heroes, ten-minute matches, and cooperative multiplayer. It was released around the same time the Razer Phone came out and quickly gained popularity. Some users have complained about the Facebook login. Apart from that, there haven't been many complaints about the game. Some heroes can be purchased through in-app purchases, as with most MOBAs.

**Features:**

• Plenty of Heros to Play With

• Fast and Fun Gameplay

• Frequent updates are making the game better day by day

### 2.Mobile Legends Bang Bang

The oldest mobile MOBA, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, was released in 2010\. The game is also the most popular from a download perspective. The game offers simple controls, five-vs-five battles, and ten-minute matches. There are ten-second matchmaking wait times according to the Google Play description. That seems exaggerated. Other than that, the game is great. Disconnected players may rejoin the same battle at any time. We found that very cool. Overall, this is one of the top MOBA games out there.

**Features:**

• Huge Collection of heroes to play

• Quick Match Making: Mostly the match starts within a few minutes

• There are plenty of modes in the game where you can take part in a 5v5 battle

A similar map to Summoner's Rift, a nearly identical set of champions, and challenging ranking mechanics make it a perfect successor to League of Legends. Although Wild Rift includes many features from the original, it also offers something new to players.

There is a lot of action in this game. Since the Nexus that protects the base turret has been removed, the game should last about 15-20 minutes, or even longer. This app has visually entertaining graphics with bright and crisp images optimized for mobile devices.

**Features:**

• Almost similar to its original version on Pc

• Eye-catching graphics and sounds

• Large Number of players worldwide

As for gameplay mechanics and responsiveness, Vainglory offers 60 frames per second gameplay and a 30-millisecond control response. Hardcore MOBA fans will find this quite satisfying.

It is the most popular MOBA on Android for a very good reason. It also has a low match waiting time due to its popularity. The game's cross-platform capabilities were unveiled in 2018\. This means it is now playable on PCs and Macs.

Two game modes are available in the game: 3v3 and Battle Royale. A three-man team fights against a third-man team like a traditional MOBA.

**Features:**

• Various Brawlers with a variety of powerful Super abilities can be collected and upgraded

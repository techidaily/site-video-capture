You can learn **how to record a Teams meeting** automatically by following the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Get to the Meeting with Box**

Launch Microsoft Teams on your computer, and use the method explained earlier to get to the **Meeting with** box by initiating a new meeting.

**Q2) Who can start or stop a recording of a Teams meeting?**

**A2)** The organizer of the meeting or a person from the same organization can start or stop the recording.

**Q3) Will people know if I start a recording on Teams meeting?**

**A3)** Yes. If you are using the Teams’ built-in recording feature to record a meeting, all the attendees will be notified about it. If you don’t want anyone to know that you are recording a session, you can use an efficient third-party app like Wondershare Filmora, and follow the steps explained earlier to learn **how to record Teams meeting** behind the scenes.

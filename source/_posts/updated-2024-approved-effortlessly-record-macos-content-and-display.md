Capturing screenshots on Mac computers is something many users are interested in learning, for a variety of reasons. Screenshots are the perfect visual accompaniment for tutorials, ideal for training and for guides, can be used to illustrate lessons in teaching tools, and more.

For simple applications, the Mac screenshot keyboard shortcuts are sufficient for the job. Here is a quick review of the built-in screenshot capability using the Mac OS:

### Tip 1. Mac OS Keyboard shortcut screenshots

• To print screen on mac (the entire screen), press \[COMMAND\] + \[SHIFT\] + 3

• To screenshot a portion of your screen, press \[COMMAND\] + \[SHIFT\] + 4; notice the cursor changes into a crosshair pointer; move the crosshair pointer where you want the screenshot to begin and drag to select; to adjust, hold \[SHIFT\], \[OPTION\] or \[SPACE BAR\] while you drag

For more advanced Mac screenshot applications, including the capability to edit, caption, and export to a variety of formats, you will need a more powerful screen capture tool to help you in taking a screenshot.

These applications can help you improve your screen captures and recordings with advanced tools and professional capabilities.

### Tip 2.Free screen capture tools for Mac

**QuickTime** – PROS: free and included with your Mac, easy to use, exports to popular Mac formats; CONS: a limited toolset for advanced editing.

**Captur** – PROS: adds menubar functionality for common screenshot tasks; CONS: not a full-fledged screenshot tool.

**Jing** – PROS: optimized for online and social sharing of screenshots, allows video capture; CONS: limited advanced feature list.

### Tip 3. More advanced all-in-one video capture & editing tools for Mac

**Movavi Screen Capture Studio** – PROS: extensive editing tools, helpful interface; CONS: no video zoom or crop options.

**Camtasia**  – PROS: professional editing tools, very helpful support options; CONS: limited export formats, not suitable for recording gaming videos.

**ScreenFlow 4** – PROS: good balance of advanced features and ease of use; CONS: limited export formats, cannot capture only portions of your screen.

 **Screenium 2.1** – PROS: a full roster of advanced editing tools; CONS: steep learning curve and poor support.

### Tip 4.Bonus Tip Wondershare Filmora for Mac

## Learn the Ins and Outs of Twitch Live Stream Archiving

Twitch is an extremely popular live video streaming platform, especially among gamers. Unless Twitch streamers enable Video on Demand, the live stream will not be accessible to the viewers later. However, it is quite possible that you cannot watch a live stream completely because you are occupied with other important works, and that is when you can record Twitch stream so that you can watch it later whenever you have time.

Even Twitch streamers may want to record their own live streams so that they can upload them on other video streaming and social media platforms. Apart from enabling VOD on Twitch by the streamers, you can record Twitch with a professional screen recorder. In this article, we have illustrated how to record Twitch streams on Windows PC and Mac easily.

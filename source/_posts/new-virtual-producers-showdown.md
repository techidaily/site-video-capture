## Part 3\. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam

Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.

**Interface:**

The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.

On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.

**Screen Recording:**

Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.

Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.

**Game Recording**:

There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.

However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.

**Live Streaming**:

Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.

OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.

## Part 4\. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video

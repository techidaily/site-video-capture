**Zoom Whiteboard**  allows you to draw your imaginations on to the screen for visual illustrations, and share those graphics with all the participants you are in a conference with. Not only this, you can even **annotate your creations**  on the whiteboard during an ongoing meeting session, and can also allow (or disallow) other members to annotate the illustrations on your board as well.

 In addition to this, you can even allow the participants to share their **whiteboard on Zoom** if you have access to multiple monitors. This way you can view multiple whiteboard illustrations from different users simultaneously.

 Here you will learn all these and many other techniques, and by the time you are done reading, you will have a fair idea on how whiteboard works, and how to use **Zoom annotation tools**  to share your imagination with others.

![Zoom Cloud Meeting Whiteboard on Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-share-multiple-screens.jpg)

#### 2\. Why can’t I see the Annotation tools?

 If you have joined a meeting hosted by someone else, it is possible that the host has prohibited other participants from annotating. In this case, you can request the host to enable annotations for the other members.

#### 3\. How to collaborate on a whiteboard in Zoom?

 If you are a participant in a Zoom conference that has been hosted by another person, collaborating on a shared whiteboard requires you to enter the full-screen mode by clicking the **Full Screen**  button at the top-right corner, clicking and opening the **Options**  menu from the top or bottom (depending on your operating system), clicking **Annotate** , and then continuing with the regular annotation process.

**Note:**  To be able to collaborate on a whiteboard, it is important that the host of the meeting has allowed the members to add annotations.

**Conclusion**

**Zoom whiteboard**  allows you to share your ideas with other participants of the conference. The good thing is, while using a desktop version, you can allow participants to share their whiteboard. You can also allow or prohibit them from annotating on the whiteboard that share. About the mobile versions, Zoom is available for both Android and iOS platforms. However, the latter variant of the app can be installed only on iPad. All in all, Zoom is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS devices where all the variants of the program share almost identical interface and therefore can be used seamlessly throughout.

#### 2\. Why can’t I see the Annotation tools?

 If you have joined a meeting hosted by someone else, it is possible that the host has prohibited other participants from annotating. In this case, you can request the host to enable annotations for the other members.

#### 3\. How to collaborate on a whiteboard in Zoom?

 If you are a participant in a Zoom conference that has been hosted by another person, collaborating on a shared whiteboard requires you to enter the full-screen mode by clicking the **Full Screen**  button at the top-right corner, clicking and opening the **Options**  menu from the top or bottom (depending on your operating system), clicking **Annotate** , and then continuing with the regular annotation process.

**Note:**  To be able to collaborate on a whiteboard, it is important that the host of the meeting has allowed the members to add annotations.

**Conclusion**

**Zoom whiteboard**  allows you to share your ideas with other participants of the conference. The good thing is, while using a desktop version, you can allow participants to share their whiteboard. You can also allow or prohibit them from annotating on the whiteboard that share. About the mobile versions, Zoom is available for both Android and iOS platforms. However, the latter variant of the app can be installed only on iPad. All in all, Zoom is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS devices where all the variants of the program share almost identical interface and therefore can be used seamlessly throughout.

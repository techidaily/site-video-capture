## Conclusion

ManyCam screen recorder is great as a live streaming platform but it does not live up to the expectations as a screen recorder.

****Cons –**

* The settings for recording video are limited and complicated.
* Too many features and functionalities make the user interface messy.
* Some glitches are reported while live streaming and recording at high resolution.
* The editing option post recording is very limited.

Therefore, it is safe to say that ManyCam as a live streaming platform is good enough but there are many limitations and dissatisfaction as far as ManyCam screen recorder is concerned. If your main objective to record professional-quality videos, ManyCam may not be suitable as there are better alternatives available.

![mednafen-poster-ps1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png)

Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.

The majority of Mednafen's cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.

**Features:**

* Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.
* Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.
* Providing you have the right PlayStation BIOS and ROM, it can be set up quickly and easily.
* The Mednafen emulator supports the use of game cheats.

### 4.ePSXe

![epsxe-ps1-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/epsxe-ps1-poster.png)

You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program. It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.

Gameplay usually runs smoothly without much configuration and trial-and-error. When your game doesn't load or you experience lags, you can fix it by applying an ePSXe patch (in .ppf format).

**Features:**

* This software provides a close analogous experience to playing video games on the PlayStation One itself, but on a personal computer.
* Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.
* It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.
* Dual-player and split-screen modes are available. Additionally, you can also use external gamepads to play your favorite video games.

In addition to the PSP, the platform can also support the Nintendo 64, Game Gear, SEGA Master System, ZX Spectrum, Neo Geo Pocket, NES, Commodore 64, and many more.

With a debugging system like this, you can analyze emulation down to the millimeter and beat time records or high scores by making the most of your video game emulation.

**Features:**

* Fire controls that operate automatically or quickly
* There are an infinite number of named savestates

**Price:** $4.99

Now you can play the award-winning board game on the go.

You and your friends become railroad barons in Ticket to Ride, hoping to be the first to link up all the railroads in the country. There is something familiar about the graphics, down to the virtual train cards you draw and hold.

Taking it in turns and passing it to your friends in front of you is part of the game's Pass-and-Play mode, but it is also excellent as a solo game. The games are designed to keep you occupied on a real-life trip on the train, taking fifteen to twenty minutes each.

**Key Features:**

* Best game for passing time with your friends offline.
* The gameplay is pretty exciting.
* The graphics of the game are what make it worthy of playing.
* The game keeps you occupied, and you will never get bored by it.

## Bonus: How to Add Video Filters on Zoom Meeting Directly?

For those who know about zoom filters and want to know how to add video filters on Zoom meetings directly, don't worry; this article has got your back. The backgrounds will let you have enhanced webinar experiences and will also allow you to make your video look better and add some flair to it.

Follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch Zoom on your computer and sign in, and go to your profile by clicking on the profile picture.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the Settings option. On the left-side menu, you need to choose Background and Filters.

**Step 3:** Now, click on the Video Filters tab, and you will come across multiple filters. Click on the filter that you want to use, and that's it.

Now you can conduct the meeting on Zoom using that video filter.

**Conclusion**

This is how you can use Snap Camera on Zoon. In case, **Snap Camera** is **not working on Zoom**, then try to force restart Snap Camera, ensure that your system meets the requirements to run Snap Camera, check if the webcam is turned on or not, and always choose the right webcam to enable Snap Camera. Other than that, using Snap Camera for Zoom meetings is incredibly easy, and you must try it out to add some personality to your video meetings, webinars, and video calls.

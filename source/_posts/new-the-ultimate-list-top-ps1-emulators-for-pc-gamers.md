## The Ultimate List: Top PS1 Emulators for PC Gamers

Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001\. The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo's SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.

Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.

![epsxe-ps1-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/epsxe-ps1-poster.png)

You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program. It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.

Gameplay usually runs smoothly without much configuration and trial-and-error. When your game doesn't load or you experience lags, you can fix it by applying an ePSXe patch (in .ppf format).

**Features:**

* This software provides a close analogous experience to playing video games on the PlayStation One itself, but on a personal computer.
* Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.
* It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.
* Dual-player and split-screen modes are available. Additionally, you can also use external gamepads to play your favorite video games.

### 5.Biz Hawk

![biz-hawk-ps1-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/biz-hawk-ps1-poster.png)

There are a lot of tools for speedrunning and emulation testing. In addition to running games from a variety of classic consoles, BizHawk is an open-source multi-system emulator. It also offers a feature to record audio and video in-game.

In addition to the PSP, the platform can also support the Nintendo 64, Game Gear, SEGA Master System, ZX Spectrum, Neo Geo Pocket, NES, Commodore 64, and many more. By allowing you to slow down or even pause the emulation, BizHawk is unique in that it allows you to advance it frame by frame. With a debugging system like this, you can analyze emulation down to the millimeter and beat time records or high scores by making the most of your video game emulation.

**Features:**

* Support for full-screen mode
* Fire controls that operate automatically or quickly
* There are an infinite number of named savestates
* Stepping, rewinding, and speed control.

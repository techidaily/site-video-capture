## Achieving Perfect Time-Lapses with iOS Devices

A timelapse video is where you record an event for a long duration at a regular interval. Due to the low frame rate, the captured long-duration video plays in a very short time.

If you own an iPad, you can create stunning timelapse videos easily. All the modern iPad variants have the timelapse feature. You can create short timelapse videos of any event and put them on social media platforms. Besides, adding a timelapse video to a regular video enhances the content. We will illustrate how to record iPad time lapse in simple steps.

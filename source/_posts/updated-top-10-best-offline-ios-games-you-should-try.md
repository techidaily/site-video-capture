This turn-based game benefits from real-world leaders, places, and historical monuments. Taking hours to complete, it's easy to enjoy it in short bursts. It is therefore perfect for iOS devices. It's possible to play local multiplayer and online multiplayer, but the offline AI campaign provides an adequate amount of entertainment during a train or plane ride.

#### **9\. New York Times Crossword**

**Price:** Free

Daily crossword puzzles are set to a high standard by Will Shortz, editor of the New York Times Crossword. With the New York Times Crossword app, you'll have access to the latest crossword every day, as well as the entire archive of past ones.

There are many other features included in the app, in addition to the puzzles themselves. The Stats page allows you to track your streaks, and the archive will enable you to do puzzles from the past or buy special crossword packs.

A Crossword subscription can be purchased separately or as part of a New York Times Digital Subscription. The Mini crossword isn't nearly as fun as a full crossword, so you'll only be able to access it if you don't subscribe.

You can keep an unlimited amount of crosswords offline for later play, even if you don't have access to the Internet to download.

#### **10\. Ticket to Ride**

**Price:** $4.99

Now you can play the award-winning board game on the go.

You and your friends become railroad barons in Ticket to Ride, hoping to be the first to link up all the railroads in the country. There is something familiar about the graphics, down to the virtual train cards you draw and hold.

Taking it in turns and passing it to your friends in front of you is part of the game's Pass-and-Play mode, but it is also excellent as a solo game. The games are designed to keep you occupied on a real-life trip on the train, taking fifteen to twenty minutes each.

* The gameplay is pretty exciting.
* The graphics of the game are what make it worthy of playing.
* The game keeps you occupied, and you will never get bored by it.

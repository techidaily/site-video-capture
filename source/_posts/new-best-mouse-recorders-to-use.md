## Best Mouse Recorders to Use

This is software that records all your mouse movements and then repeats these actions accurately. Mouse movement recorder is very useful and can save you a lot of time and effort. This includes adding conditional statements, custom commands such as "open file", "launch website" or "shutdown computer". The main advantage of using a macro recorder is that it allows a user to easily perform complex operations much faster and with less effort without requiring custom computer programming or scripting. Some examples of mouse recorders are:

## Macro Recorder

Macro Recorder captures mouse events and keystrokes like a tape recorder, allowing you to automate tedious procedures on your computer. When you record a macro, the macro recorder records all the steps in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code. These steps can include typing text or numbers, clicking cells or commands on the ribbon or menus, formatting cells, rows, or columns, or even importing data from an external source, say, Microsoft Access. Visual Basic Application (VBA) is a subset of the powerful Visual Basic programming language and is included with most Office applications. Although VBA gives you the ability to automate processes within and between Office applications, it is not necessary to know VBA code or computer programming if the Macro Recorder does what you want.

![macro recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macro-recorder.jpg)

It is important to know that when you record a macro, the Macro Recorder captures almost every move you make. So if you make a mistake in your sequence, for example, clicking a button that you did not intend to click, the Macro Recorder will record it. The resolution is to re-record the entire sequence or modify the VBA code itself. This is why whenever you record something, it's best to record a process with which you're highly familiar. The more smoothly you record a sequence, the more efficiently the macro will run when you play it back.

**Pros of Using a Macro Recorder**

* Macro recorders offer many advantages to those who choose to use them:
* They reduce the possibility of human error that increases with many, repetitive keystrokes and tasks.
* Macro recorders reduce the amount of time that must be spent performing basic computing tasks.
* When using a macro recorder, the user is freed up for more complex problem-solving tasks and idea-generating activities.
* Macro muse recorders also make complex computations easier to perform.
* They are easy to create, store and use
* Mouse macro software is easy to edit. Once you record a macro, you can easily alter them to efficiently suit your needs.
* A user can use the macro recorder on Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

**Cons of Using a Macro Recorder**

* The disadvantage of a macro recorder is the size of the program. The reason is, the pre-processor will replace all the macros in the program by their real definition before the compilation process of the program.
* While macros can be recorded in many applications, the macro recorder doesn't know what you're trying to do, so it just takes a snapshot of the whole feature. That makes for a very messy chunk of code that does a lot of unnecessary things, some of which you may not want.
* The disadvantage of a macro recorder pro app is that here the entire code is substituted so the program becomes lengthy if a macro is called several times.

## Jitbit Macro Recorder

The mouse recorder will attempt to replay your mouse moves at the same speed by inserting "delay" commands into the recorded macro. But if you don't need this, you can: Increase the playback speed in "Settings". Jitbit is not just a keyboard and mouse recorder but a powerful automation tool that converts macros to EXE files and more.

![jitbit macro recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jitbit-macro-recorder.jpg)

**Pros of Jitbit Macrorecorder**

* Easy to try.
* Extremely simple.
* Is flexible.
* It's a automation software.
* C# scripting language - you can insert code snippets in C#
* Uses EXE-compiler.
* Easily very accessible.

**Cons of Using JitbitMacro Recorder**

* The product is highly customizable which is great but it can also be a bit bland on the UI/UX side.
* It can be a little slow and gets a glitch sometimes, however so can most programs. It's a learning process and it gets easier and easier over time.
* The software is desperately missing the ability to log out a user. As admins, we use a regular user for working with tickets and an admin user for administrative tasks. Currently, there's no way to switch between the two without deleting cookies, going Incognito, or using a different browser. Very cumbersome.

## Macro Recorder

Macro Recorder captures mouse events and keystrokes like a tape recorder, allowing you to automate tedious procedures on your computer. When you record a macro, the macro recorder records all the steps in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code. These steps can include typing text or numbers, clicking cells or commands on the ribbon or menus, formatting cells, rows, or columns, or even importing data from an external source, say, Microsoft Access. Visual Basic Application (VBA) is a subset of the powerful Visual Basic programming language and is included with most Office applications. Although VBA gives you the ability to automate processes within and between Office applications, it is not necessary to know VBA code or computer programming if the Macro Recorder does what you want.

![macro recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macro-recorder.jpg)

It is important to know that when you record a macro, the Macro Recorder captures almost every move you make. So if you make a mistake in your sequence, for example, clicking a button that you did not intend to click, the Macro Recorder will record it. The resolution is to re-record the entire sequence or modify the VBA code itself. This is why whenever you record something, it's best to record a process with which you're highly familiar. The more smoothly you record a sequence, the more efficiently the macro will run when you play it back.

**Pros of Using a Macro Recorder**

* Macro recorders offer many advantages to those who choose to use them:
* They reduce the possibility of human error that increases with many, repetitive keystrokes and tasks.
* Macro recorders reduce the amount of time that must be spent performing basic computing tasks.
* When using a macro recorder, the user is freed up for more complex problem-solving tasks and idea-generating activities.
* Macro muse recorders also make complex computations easier to perform.
* They are easy to create, store and use
* Mouse macro software is easy to edit. Once you record a macro, you can easily alter them to efficiently suit your needs.
* A user can use the macro recorder on Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

**Cons of Using a Macro Recorder**

* The disadvantage of a macro recorder is the size of the program. The reason is, the pre-processor will replace all the macros in the program by their real definition before the compilation process of the program.
* While macros can be recorded in many applications, the macro recorder doesn't know what you're trying to do, so it just takes a snapshot of the whole feature. That makes for a very messy chunk of code that does a lot of unnecessary things, some of which you may not want.
* The disadvantage of a macro recorder pro app is that here the entire code is substituted so the program becomes lengthy if a macro is called several times.

## Jitbit Macro Recorder

The mouse recorder will attempt to replay your mouse moves at the same speed by inserting "delay" commands into the recorded macro. But if you don't need this, you can: Increase the playback speed in "Settings". Jitbit is not just a keyboard and mouse recorder but a powerful automation tool that converts macros to EXE files and more.

## AutoHotkey

AutoHotkey is a free and open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation, and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application.

![auto hotkey](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-hotkey.jpg)

AutoHotkey provides a simple, flexible syntax allowing you to focus more on the task at hand rather than every single little technicality. It supports not only the popular imperative-procedural paradigm but also object-oriented and command-based programming.

**Pros of AutoHotkey**

* Remap easy to reach but rarely used keys.
* Use any keys as modifiers.
* Make the mouse wheel perform alt-tabbing.
* Make a keyboard key become a mouse button.
* Make your hotkeys context-sensitive.
* Define abbreviations that expand as you type them.

**Cons of AutoHotkey**

* The base syntax, inherited from the first version of AutoIt, is primitive (a bit like an improved batch syntax).
* Seem to exist some flame wars between the two language communities

![mouse recorder pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mouse-recorder-pro.jpg)

* It is small-sized
* Has a variety of configuration options
* Makes your script perform faster using the in-built configurations.

* Cons of Mouse Recorder Pro

## Auto Click Typer

This is a lightweight and user-friendly software solution developed to offer you an easy means of automating various mouse and keyboard presses, allowing you to get out of doing repetitive tasks, which your computer can very well handle without your intervention.

You can type in just about any word or text, and then you can be rewarded with the words, phrases, or even logos, when you give the auto clicker type a keyword or short key. The program then goes ahead and types the correct words into the Auto Clicker Typer box, and it then waits for your response

**Pros of Auto Click Typer**

* Provides a user-friendly interface
* Creates and edits mouse and keyboard action
* It is a freeware software; there's no need to register and can be used for a lifetime
* 100% safe from malware and adware
* Works smoothly on any webpage
* One of the main benefits of using this type of system is that it is very easy to install.

**Cons of Auto Click Typer**

* The biggest disadvantage associated with an auto clicker is that it is not very effective at identifying specific words or phrases used in a particular setting. It has a much smaller memory and can only remember a limited number of keywords. If you want to use a clicker to determine who your customers are, you will need to use many keywords to identify them. If you use just one keyword, for example, it will not have a good enough memory to remember the exact spelling variations of this word.
* There are also a few problems with the concept of a clicker. For instance, they require a continuous activity for them to work efficiently, and most people find them too hard to use, and a waste of time.

## GhostMouse

This mouse recorder allows you to record and automate a sequence of mouse clicks and keystrokes on a Windows PC. To start the recording process, click on record and start simulating the keyboard and mouse actions you would like the ghostmouse app to record. To play the recorded sequence, hit Play. It is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, and 64-bit systems.

GhostMouse is a tiny program that lets you record and playback a series of mouse movements like right clicks and drags and drop movements.

**Pros of GhostMouse**

* Easy to use
* It's freely accessible.
* Has overlay graphics to visualize the recorded mouse paths and clicks.
* Automate any action on windows desktop applications or web pages.
* Uses the macro editor to create macros.
* Adjusts macro recording filters within the mouse recorder for windows.

**Cons of GhostMouse**

* Unlike other programs, designed to record and replicate use actions, the ghostmouse recorder is limited to mouse tasks.
* Needs someone with a piece of programming knowledge to customize.

## Conclusion

Mouse Recorder is a unique PC-based application that allows you to record your mouse movements on a screen. A mouse recorder can be a great option for those who are recording how-to webinars for a later date or those who wish to troubleshoot any issues that they may be having with a given website. This app is free to download.

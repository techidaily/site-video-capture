If you have to communicate the step-by-guide to someone, screen recording is the best idea. Using a ZD Soft recorder is the way towards it. The software gives the user mouse effects to draw markups and annotate the ongoing operations. Additionally, the microphone can be used to narrate what you are doing at a particular moment.

Moreover, the unnecessary parts of the video can be eliminated without any complications. The user can share or export the video output to a diverse set of platforms.

### Screenshot Capturing Functionality with Livestream

While screen recording is one of the strengths of this application, taking screenshots in real-time makes the process more productive. Additionally, live broadcasting is another workable feature of the ZD Soft screen recorder. Primarily used by content creators, one can go live through their screen and showcase multiple operations.

#### **9\. New York Times Crossword**

**Price:** Free

Daily crossword puzzles are set to a high standard by Will Shortz, editor of the New York Times Crossword. With the New York Times Crossword app, you'll have access to the latest crossword every day, as well as the entire archive of past ones.

There are many other features included in the app, in addition to the puzzles themselves. The Stats page allows you to track your streaks, and the archive will enable you to do puzzles from the past or buy special crossword packs.

A Crossword subscription can be purchased separately or as part of a New York Times Digital Subscription. The Mini crossword isn't nearly as fun as a full crossword, so you'll only be able to access it if you don't subscribe.

You can keep an unlimited amount of crosswords offline for later play, even if you don't have access to the Internet to download.

* Best gaming for spending your free time.
* The game helps you to sharpen your brain and memory.
* The in-app purchases can further enhance the gameplay to a huge extent.

#### **10\. Ticket to Ride**

**Price:** $4.99

Now you can play the award-winning board game on the go.

You and your friends become railroad barons in Ticket to Ride, hoping to be the first to link up all the railroads in the country. There is something familiar about the graphics, down to the virtual train cards you draw and hold.

Taking it in turns and passing it to your friends in front of you is part of the game's Pass-and-Play mode, but it is also excellent as a solo game. The games are designed to keep you occupied on a real-life trip on the train, taking fifteen to twenty minutes each.

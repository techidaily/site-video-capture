## Guide to Initiating and Archiving Webinars Economically

In this world of digitization, webinars are the best online events for educating the masses and promoting products and services. If you have subscribed to any free or paid webinar, you should be ready to record the webinar so that you can go through the webinar at any future instance. Since webinars are live online events, you cannot watch them again if you do not record the webinars.

Recording a webinar is useful to understand any concept that you could not understand when it was getting broadcast. If you cannot be present all the time to attend the webinar, you can record the webinar and check it out later. In fact, you can share the recorded webinar with anyone at any time. If you want to record webinar free, we have lined up the best webinar recording software applications.

## Part 5\. Online Webinar Recording

If you do not want to go for any webinar recording software free download on your computer, you can opt for an online screen recorder. This is useful for those who record webinar on the go or those who record once in a while. There are several online free screen recorders available but not all of them are safe and sound. We prefer Apowersoft free online recorder as it is a trusted recorder and it has all the required features completely. Here are the steps on how to record webinar online.

Step 1: Open your web browser and visit apowersoft.id/free-online-screen-recorder.

Step 2: Click on Start Recording and download the launcher.

Step 3: Install the launcher and click on Start Recording button again. Select the region for recording and check the system sound is set perfectly.

Step 4: Open the webinar on the screen that you want to record and click on Rec button on Apowersoft widget.

Step 5: To stop recording, click on Stop icon on the floating widget and the recorded video will be shown on your computer.

## Conclusion

It is always better to record webinar whether you are a presenter or a viewer. You can always go through the entire webinar once again and revise all the points discussed. We have selected the best webinar recording software free download for you that you can use as per your device. For the best outcome, we recommend Wondershare Filmora which is a professional screen recorder with video editor.

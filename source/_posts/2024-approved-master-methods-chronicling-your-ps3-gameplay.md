Step 3: Select Capture Any Fullscreen Application from Mode drop-down list.

Step 4: Click on OK button and you will see your Game Capture session under Sources.

Step 5: Open your PS3 gameplay on your computer screen and you will see the game on the OBS window.

Step 6: Click on Start Recording button and start playing on PS3\. The recording will go on in the background.

Step 7: Once you are done, come back to OBS and click on Stop Recording.

## The Bottom Line

Even though PlayStation 3 is not the latest gaming console and there is no built-in screen recorder like PS4 and PS5, you can still record your gameplay and upload on social media and video streaming platforms. The best way is to buy a capture card and use Filmora to record PS3 gameplay flawlessly. You can edit the recorded video and make it more interesting to get positive feedback from online viewers.

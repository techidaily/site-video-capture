## Part 1: How Does the Mute Button in Google Meet Work?

The mute button in Google Meet is like a blessing in disguise, with just one click you can silence your mic. This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else. So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

## Part 3: How to Mute Someone in Google Meet?

There are times when individuals are not aware that the background noise of their surroundings is causing a disturbance in the meeting. That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.

### The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet

Before looking into **how to mute someone on Google Meet**, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,

* During video calls that are hosted through personal Google accounts, only the moderator can mute a person.
* Google Meet calls made through Google workspace accounts only permit a person, from the domain which organized the meeting, to mute a participant.
* During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting / is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.

So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session. The process involves the following steps,

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

Click on the arrow next to the name of the person you would like to mute. Once you do that, a drop-down menu will appear with three options.

Additionally, the Google Meet mute all function is only available for Educational accounts and it can only be used by meeting creators and owners of the calendars.

### 2\. How to Remove A Participant from Google Meet Without Being A Host

If you are not the host, then regretfully, you can not remove a certain participant from the meeting. However, if you download an extension, that might do the trick to enable this feature.

#### FAQs about Muting People on Google Meet

**Q1) Will people know if I mute myself on Google Meet?**

Yes, people will definitely know that you have muted yourself, as your microphone will appear on the screens of other participants with a canceled sign on it.

**Q2) What To Do If You Have Been Muted in Google Meet?**

If you get muted by someone else in the session, then you can unmute yourself by clicking on the microphone icon at the bottom of your meeting window or press “\*6” keys to unmute yourself.

#### Are you Ready to Use the Mute Function on Google Meet?

The mute feature on Google Meet is truly very simplistic and handy to use. All one has to do is click a few buttons and they are good to go! Follow the process mentioned above, and you will have the easiest time making use of the Google Meet mute feature.

## Capture High-Quality Video Using MacBook's Webcam

In this article, I'll show you how to record your webcam on a Mac using various screen recorders. MacBook has been widely used for quite some time, and it has not only maintained its competitive edge over the years, but has also modernized and improved its services. Apple's operating system also has a built-in video recorder called as QuickTime player. It can also be used for capture and video recording, but it lacks the productivity and customization capabilities of the other tools in this article.

Now there are many famous tools such as Filmora, OBS, QuickTime player, Camtasia etc. So I will be listing down their pros and cons for you to decide which one works best for you. They are all great applications but as everyone has a different perspective so there is no such thing as favorite.

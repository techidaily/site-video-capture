## Part 1: Requirements for Google Meet Recording

So, you need to fulfill specific requirements before you enjoy the recording feature in Google Meet. The following section of the article highlights requirements for recording Google meet sessions.

### 1. Permission from Google Administrator

The recording feature must be enabled on the Google administrator account. Once the recording is allowed, you can record in Google meet both as a host or participant of the meeting.

### 2. Workspace Account

The recording feature is not available for ordinary Gmail accounts. So, you need access to educational, business, or standard workspace accounts. In addition to this, workspace editions are also offered in the enterprise and teaching faculty category.

### 3. Operational microphone

Your microphone must be in working condition when you start recording Google meet sessions. However, if you want only screen recording with no audio input, you can continue the recording process.

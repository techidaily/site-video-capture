As a user of Filmora Wondershare there is no doubt that you will be impressed with the number of functions that are available with the software and also the general capability of it.

In terms of what videos you can import and edit etc. On its newest release of Filmora, it will no longer just be a video editor but it will have a screen recording function added to it as well, as well as a video stabiliser and reverse tool. Best thing about this is current users of the software will be able to download this update complete free of charge. So, how could this function be used?

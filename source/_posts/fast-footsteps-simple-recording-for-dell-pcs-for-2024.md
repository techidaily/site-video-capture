In this article, we have illustrated how to screen record on Dell laptop in all possible ways.

## Way 1\. Record with Game Bar

You most likely have Windows 10 installed on your Dell laptop. Windows 10 comes with an inbuilt screen recorder called Game Bar. You can record your screen as well as capture screenshots as per your requirements. You even capture your system as well as external mic audio. Besides, you can view your system performance from its widget. After capturing a screenshot, you can copy and paste it anywhere. Besides, you can share it on Twitter instantly. Here are the steps on how to record screen on Dell laptop using Windows Game Bar.

Step 1: Press Windows + G keys to open Game Bar on your Dell laptop screen.

## Way 2\. Use VLC Screen Recorder

Even though Windows Media Player is the default medial player on Windows, users prefer VLC Media Player over Windows Media Player.

Most importantly, you can use VLC Media Player to record your screen on Dell laptop and view the recorded video instantly on VLC Media Player as well. Here are the steps to screen record Dell laptop using VLC Media Player as screen recorder.

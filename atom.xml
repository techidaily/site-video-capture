The PNG files support lossless data compression, just like GIF files and they are the most commonly used lossless data compression format on the Internet. However, there are a few downsides, including the size of the PNG files that can prompt you to set another file format as the default screenshot file format on your Mac.</p><p>Using JPEG file extension will enable you to create images that can be used in Word documents, PowerPoint presentations or shared anywhere on the Internet. PDF or TIFF files should only be used if you want to print the screenshot you’ve taken, while the GIF file format is used to create short animations or loops and there is absolutely no reason to use it as a default screenshot file format.</p><h2 id="Which-Screenshot-Format-Should-You-Use"><a href="#Which-Screenshot-Format-Should-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="Which Screenshot Format Should You Use?"></a>Which Screenshot Format Should You Use?</h2><p>Each image file format Mac computer support is designed for different purposes, which is the reason why you should choose the screenshot graphics format that best fits the context in which the file is going to be used. Converting PNG files to some popular file format is almost always necessary, so if you want to avoid having to go through the file conversion process every time you take a screenshot just to be able to edit it, our advice is to set the JPEG as the default screenshot file format on your Mac.</p><p>Besides being smaller in size than PNG files, JPEG files are also handier if you want to annotate the screenshots you’re taking. In addition, you’ll be able to post your files anywhere on the Internet, because JPEG files are supported by all social media platforms.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Change-Screenshot-Formats"><a href="#How-to-Change-Screenshot-Formats" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Screenshot Formats?"></a>How to Change Screenshot Formats?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-format-changing.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots formats "                ></p><p>Once you decide which format you want to use the default screenshot graphics format on your Mac, you should launch the Terminal app. You can access the Terminal from the Utility subfolder that is located in the Application folder.</p><p>When the Terminal window appears on the screen you will have to insert the following command:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg</strong></p><p>As you can see, the command ends with .jpg, which is, in this case, the default graphics format to which you will be switching to. The command line is the same for all other file formats, and the only difference is the file extension at the end.</p><p>Press the Return or Enter button to execute the command and then proceeded to confirm the changes you’ve made by resetting the UI and entering this command line:</p><p><strong>killall</strong> <strong>SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Press the Enter key, to complete the process and enjoy taking screenshots in the JPEG file format. This step is necessary for changing all other graphics formats supported by Mac computers, and the command line is always the same.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the screenshot file format to TIFF, GIF, PDF or PNG. Simply insert the appropriate command line and make sure to restart Mac’s UI by entering the <strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong> command after you change the graphics format.</p><p><strong>The Command line for changing the Screenshot format to TIFF:</strong></p><p><em>defaults write com.apple.screencapture type TIFF</em></p><p><strong>PDF:</strong></p><p><em>defaults write com.apple.screencapture type PDF</em></p><p><strong>GIF:</strong></p><p><em>defaults write com.apple.screencapture type GIF</em></p><p><strong>PNG:</strong></p><p><em>defaults write com.apple.screencapture type PNG</em></p><p>You can switch back to capturing screenshots in PNG file format at any moment by simply following the steps we described for all other image file formats supported by the macOS.

They can look stunning, particularly on the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and they can overwhelm with interesting new twists on the tried-and-true shooter concept. They often put us against brainy villains and those who wish to devour them. And they never fail to wow with their speed and flair.</p><p>While talking about Best Fps Games’ first-person shooters are one of the most popular game genres, picking the top 30 examples is difficult. We need a set of laws, but even then, another ten are killed by a headshot for every gunman who makes it through. On this list, we’ll look at games with first-person shooting as their main mechanic. In 2021, the game should be playable right now. Multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are hot, while first-person action RPGs like Fallout 4 and action-adventure games like Deathloop are out and known as best Fps games. These are the guidelines. Shooting the messenger isn’t a good idea.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the 7 best Fps games available right now.</p><h3 id="1-BLACK-MESA"><a href="#1-BLACK-MESA" class="headerlink" title="1.BLACK MESA"></a>1.BLACK MESA</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/black-mesa-poster.jpg"                      alt="black-mesa-poster"                ></p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine. Black Mesa took 15 years to achieve version 1.0, but it’s well worth waiting when it was released in 2020. To offer a more condensed experience, the remake is a revised version of the classic single-player campaign, with no outdated puzzles or battle sequences. The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1’s last chapter.</p><p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa. Black Mesa is the greatest way to see what you’ve been losing out on if you haven’t experienced the original Half-Life game.

These honors are also well-deserved. Half-Life 2 is a tremendously ambitious game that benefits from being created by a much more confident valve.</p><p>Everything is larger this time around than in 1998: the settings, the adversaries, the narrative - it’s a blockbuster but a smart one.

Not only are there over 60 weapons in Escape from Tarkov, but each one may be modified or stripped down to the point of being unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents. For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds. These reasons are enough for this game to make a place in the best Fps games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Realistic modeling.</p><p>• Unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents.</p><h3 id="7-TITANFALL-2"><a href="#7-TITANFALL-2" class="headerlink" title="7.TITANFALL 2"></a>7.TITANFALL 2</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/titanfall-2.jpg"                      alt="titanfall-2"                ></p><p>EA and Respawn improved on what the original game did well, and the multiplayer in this shooter sequel was so perfectly balanced that it became one of the best Fps games of 2016. Titanfall 2’s mix of gritty, industrial mech brawling and agile pilot combat is unparalleled. The solo mode of Titanfall 2 also offers a great introduction to the game’s mechanics and a fascinating, self-contained story, as you’ll discover in our Titanfall 2 campaign review.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Perfectly balanced.</p><p>• Self-contained story.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine.

Black MESA is included in this list of the greatest FPS games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Recreation of Half-Life.</p><p>• More concise experience.</p><h3 id="2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS-3"><a href="#2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS-3" class="headerlink" title="2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS"></a>2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops.jpg"                      alt="call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops"                ></p><p>Following the success of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot and Warzone, Black Ops – Cold War needed to live up to Infinity Ward’s expectations. Fortunately, Cold War stands up to the hype, and the result is a game that is both snappy and fast-paced, two key characteristics of a successful Call of Duty game so cold war black ops make their place in the best Fps games.</p><p>Cold War embraces the absurdity of its alternative history premise, enabling the developers to include characters like John McClane and Rambo in the mix. There are various endings in the campaign, including one in which Russia wins the Cold War. The multiplayer mode, updated every two months with fresh material, has to be the game’s highlight. This isn’t limited to multiplayer maps; entirely new modes, such as the large-scale Zombies Outbreak mode, have been introduced to the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Snappy and fast-paced.</p><p>• Multiplayer mode.</p><p>• Large-scale Zombies Outbreak mode.</p><h3 id="3-OVERWATCH-3"><a href="#3-OVERWATCH-3" class="headerlink" title="3.OVERWATCH"></a>3.OVERWATCH</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/overwatch.jpg"                      alt="overwatch"                ></p><p>If you want to compare it to Team Fortress 2 or League of Legends, go ahead. Overwatch has enough in common with both to share part of their attraction, but it’s distinct enough that figuring out the greatest character combinations will take months.</p><p>Overwatch is a cooperative game, not a game about who murdered you and how many headshots you received. More important is how you utilized your diverse combination of abilities as Mercy to rescue a vital sniper just on capture point, drive the payload forward on Reinhart’s shield, or even win around.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Eclectic mix bag of skills.</p><p>• Push the payload ahead with Reinhart’s shield.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-GLOBAL-OFFENSIVE-COUNTER-STRIKE-3"><a href="#4-GLOBAL-OFFENSIVE-COUNTER-STRIKE-3" class="headerlink" title="4.GLOBAL OFFENSIVE COUNTER-STRIKE"></a>4.GLOBAL OFFENSIVE COUNTER-STRIKE</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cs-go.png"                      alt="cs-go"                ></p><p>For the first time, stepping into the world of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is akin to plunging into a contemporary military meat grinder.

These honors are also well-deserved. Half-Life 2 is a tremendously ambitious game that benefits from being created by a much more confident valve.</p><p>Everything is larger this time around than in 1998: the settings, the adversaries, the narrative - it’s a blockbuster but a smart one. There are excellent AI partners; genuine people that exist to do more than die hilariously; and mechanics that make the environment feel real and substantial.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Tremendously ambitious game.</p><p>• The blockbuster environment feels.</p><h3 id="6-Escape-from-TARKOV-3"><a href="#6-Escape-from-TARKOV-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Escape from TARKOV"></a>6.Escape from TARKOV</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/escape-from-tarkov.jpg"                      alt="escape-from-tarkov"                ></p><p>There are a lot of FPS games that claim to be realistic, but none compare to Escape from Tarkov’s dev team’s fanatical attention to detail when it comes to weapons, attachments, and ballistics modeling. Not only are there over 60 weapons in Escape from Tarkov, but each one may be modified or stripped down to the point of being unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents. For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds. These reasons are enough for this game to make a place in the best Fps games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Realistic modeling.</p><p>• Unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents.</p><h3 id="7-TITANFALL-2-3"><a href="#7-TITANFALL-2-3" class="headerlink" title="7.TITANFALL 2"></a>7.TITANFALL 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/titanfall-2.jpg"                      alt="titanfall-2"                ></p><p>EA and Respawn improved on what the original game did well, and the multiplayer in this shooter sequel was so perfectly balanced that it became one of the best Fps games of 2016. Titanfall 2’s mix of gritty, industrial mech brawling and agile pilot combat is unparalleled. The solo mode of Titanfall 2 also offers a great introduction to the game’s mechanics and a fascinating, self-contained story, as you’ll discover in our Titanfall 2 campaign review.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Perfectly balanced.</p><p>• Self-contained story.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a href="#">Try It

The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera.

The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast.

How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

The outcome is subsequently streamed live to your streaming platforms of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, and&#x2F;or to a recorder.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-effortlessly-transform-youtube-tunes-to-mp3-with-mac/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Effortlessly Transform YouTube Tunes to MP3 with Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-encompass-entire-webpage-in-view/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Encompass Entire Webpage in View</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-playgrounds-for-virtual-escapades/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Essential Playgrounds for Virtual Escapades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unleash-film-potential-on-instagram-with-these-3-edges/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unleash Film Potential on Instagram with These 3 Edges</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-evaluating-the-updated-movavi-video-editor/"><u>[New] Evaluating the Updated Movavi Video Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-how-to-capture-computer-screens-and-webcam-video-simultaneously-on-windows10-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Capture Computer Screens and Webcam Video Simultaneously on Windows10 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-free-yourself-from-cash-for-sound-the-best-18-audio-crackers-on-youtube/"><u>[New] In 2024, Free Yourself From Cash for Sound  The Best 18 Audio Crackers on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ranking-video-chat-winning-windows-tools-6-1/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ranking Video Chat Winning Windows Tools #6-#1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-tech-tips-snagging-your-fb-status-video/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tech Tips  Snagging Your FB Status Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-simplycapture-windows-screens-in-minutes-for-2024/"><u>[New] SimplyCapture -

However, there are quite a few downsides to traditional PPT files, PowerPoint produces because the contents of your presentations can be easily modified and used by someone else.</p><p>The 2010 and later versions of PowerPoint have addressed this issue by including the Save to Video option that enabled users to create video files which can be easily posted on social media, video sharing platforms or used in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion option featured in recent versions of PowerPoint has certain limitations that prevent you from choosing the video file format or including inserted media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.</p><p>That’s the reason why we’ve gathered 10 best PPT to video converters that make the process of producing a video from a PowerPoint presentation easy and fun.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Choosing-PPT-to-Video-Converter-Software"><a href="#Tips-for-Choosing-PPT-to-Video-Converter-Software" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software"></a>Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software</h2><p>Investing your money wisely is always a good idea because the most expensive solution is often not the best solution. The same is true for PPT to Video converter software, so before you go ahead and choose the program you will be using to convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos here are a few tips that will help you make up your mind.</p><p>Checking the amount of video file formats supported by the software is the key step towards selecting the right converter because it will give you the versatility the PowerPoint’s built-in PPT to video converter lacks. What’s more, some of the programs for PPT to video file conversions don’t allow you to convert audio files or animations into videos, which can ruin the original presentation, so prior to buying a software make sure that it can turn multimedia files into videos as well.</p><p>Last, but certainly not the least, try to determine whether or not the software is cost-effective because there is absolutely no point in spending a lot of money on a software that has the same PPT to video file conversion capabilities as PowerPoint.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-Best-PPT-to-Video-Converters"><a href="#10-Best-PPT-to-Video-Converters" class="headerlink" title="10 Best PPT to Video Converters"></a>10 Best PPT to Video Converters</h2><h4 id="1-Wondershare-PPT2Video-Pro"><a href="#1-Wondershare-PPT2Video-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, Google Meet does not allow all accounts to use filters and mask in the same way. To cut the story short, some of the masks and filters might be accessible with workspace, while others are only usable through your personal Gmail accounts. Workplace place accounts need to be professional with limited filters and effects available for them. If you want to know the requirements for using filters and effects on specific devices and different accounts, the following section will discuss them in detail.</p><ul><li><strong>Account</strong></li></ul><p>Using your personal account rather than the workplace account is better to use maximum filters, effects, and masks.

A layer can be described as any type of image, moving or still, that is superimposed over a background image. However, just adding one layer over another will not create a strong visual impact on the spectator, which is why using Blending Modes is recommended if you want to <strong>blend two overlaying videos or images</strong> seamlessly.</p><p>It is a widely accepted opinion that Blend Modes can only be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects, but in this article, we are going to bust that myth and show you how to utilize Blending Modes in Filmora Scrn.

Two pieces of film are transparent, but the images they contain do not mix with each other, that is why when you are using Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn you are actually merging videos and allowing their pixels to mix.</p><p>Different ways of combining pixels are called modes, and for that reason, the properties of the <strong>Linear Burn mode</strong> are not the same as the properties of the <strong>Multiply blending mode</strong>. Each mode you select, brings preset image transparency as well as brightness, contrast and color values. Which mode you will use depends mostly on the context and the images you want to use in your video.</p><p>The <strong>Normal mode</strong> is a part of the standard set of blending modes in almost all photo and video editing programs. It enables you to keep the top layer intact, by preventing the pixels from two images to merge. It is a perfect PIP blending mode since it allows you to keep two overlaying images separate and have two different narratives within the same shot. Producers of YouTube videos and tutorials of any kind or gamers who want to entertain their audiences should use the Normal mode when editing their footage captured with Filmora Scrn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-normal-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>The <strong>Screen Mode</strong> is best used when you are working with dark monochrome backgrounds because it reduces the dark areas in the video thus enabling you to blend the top layer into the background seamlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-screen-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>Utilizing this mode successfully requires previous preparation because the effects you’ll get if you use the Screen mode with a footage that is not best suited for this mode are far from impressive. Therefore, the video clips you want to overlay and blend with each other must be recorded perfectly in order to get the best results.</p><p>The <strong>Multiply Mode</strong> is also one of the frequently used blending modes that <strong>multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the overlaying video clip</strong> with a matching pixel from the background video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-multiply-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>This mode will enable you to create the black background for your video effortlessly, and highlight the subjects in the video clip you intend to use as a top layer.

Filmora Scrn features a number of different blending modes, so figuring out what each mode can do may take some time and practice. Let’s have a look at how you can add multiple layers to your videos and how to use blending modes.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-files-into-Filmora-Scrn"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-files-into-Filmora-Scrn" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Importing files into Filmora Scrn"></a>Step 1 - Importing files into Filmora Scrn</h4><p>In case you’ve used Filmora Scrn’s screen recorder to capture your video, the video clip will be opened in the software’s video editor and placed in the media bin, immediately after the recording session is over.

You have the ability to stop the procedure at any time.</li><li>After you’ve finished recording, go to the menu (Home) and select “Recordings,” which will allow you to tweak and personalize your films exactly how you want them.</li><li>The quality of the screen recording option is noticeably lower than that of the tool’s game recording mode. In contrast to the others, this model is significantly more user-friendly.

As the name implies, it is clear that users can record their gameplay and view their frames per second with no delays. Its game recording mode is designed specifically for game recording and works well with games that use DirectX, OpenGL, or Vulkan graphics technologies. This mode requires additional gear and allows you to record in high quality from any external source. For the greatest results, while recording game consoles, you should use a PCI&#x2F;PCI-E capturing card.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>Bandicam</th><th>Camtasia</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Video Editing</td><td>video chopping, joining, freezing frames, and changing the volume.</td><td>basic video editing tools and advanced effects like green screen.</td></tr><tr><td>Recording Frame</td><td>60 fps</td><td>60 fps</td></tr><tr><td>Supported System:</td><td>All Windows systems</td><td>Windows and Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Screen Record</td><td>A wide range of screen recording options</td><td>It has a variety of editing and recording features</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$39.95</td><td>$299.99</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You should have a good understanding of the differences between Camtasia and Bandicam after reading this article.

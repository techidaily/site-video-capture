In comparison to OBS, it is a highly user-friendly interface for easy operation.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong> <strong>-</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows only.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 1 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam-3"><a href="#Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video"></a>Part 4. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video</h2><p>If you are not satisfied with OBS for its complicated user interface and you are looking for a better alternative to Bandicam, we recommend Filmora - a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for both PC and Mac. Both OBS and Bandicam have very limited features in editing a video when editing is essential after you record a video. This is where Filmora scores over OBS and Bandicam. You can capture the screen, record video from webcam as well as record audio from different sources.</p><p>It is a professional video editor with loads of options to edit your recorded video and make it crisp and eye-catching. Therefore, it is a value for money product, and that is why Filmora is one of the most preferred applications among beginners and professionals. Here are the steps to record the screen with Filmora.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora. It is available for Windows and Mac. Open Filmora and click on PC Screen option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Step 2: Select the recording screen size, the microphone and the system audio.

You can press F9 key to stop recording.</p><p>You can then edit the recording and export in the desired file format.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To sum it up for you, OBS is completely free while Bandicam is a premium software. In terms of features, there is not much difference but Bandicam is significantly use to easy. Bandicam has more options for better screen recording but it lacks useful editing options. If you are looking for a better alternative Bandicam, we recommend Wondershare Filmora and you can record and edit video like a professional.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/firefoxs-best-screen-recorders-roundup/"><u>Firefox's Best Screen Recorders Roundup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-expertly-curated-list-premium-ubuscreen-recorder-apps-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expertly Curated List  Premium UbuScreen Recorder Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-full-screen-glitch-resolved-in-obs/"><u>2024 Approved  Full-Screen Glitch Resolved in Obs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-screen-recording-innovations-a-comparative-look-for-2024/"><u>[New] Screen Recording Innovations  A Comparative Look for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-alternatives-to-microsofts-game-bar-recording-features/"><u>2024 Approved  Best Alternatives to Microsoft's Game Bar Recording Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-mac-screen-recorders-ranked-a-comprehensive-analysis/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top Mac Screen Recorders Ranked  A Comprehensive Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-audiophiles-guide-to-choosing-best-live-streamers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Audiophiles' Guide to Choosing Best Live Streamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-choosing-between-obs-and-fraps-for-excellent-screen-capture/"><u>In 2024, Choosing Between OBS and Fraps for Excellent Screen Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-pixel-powerhouse-comparing-leading-8k-tv-innovations/"><u>In 2024, Pixel Powerhouse  Comparing Leading 8K TV Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-google-meet-capture-made-simple-for-mobile-users/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Google Meet Capture Made Simple for Mobile Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-free-webm-video-editing-solutions-top-10-options/"><u>2024 Approved Free WebM Video Editing Solutions Top 10 Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-immersing-viewers-in-new-realities-the-vr-film-revolution/"><u>2024 Approved  Immersing Viewers in New Realities  The VR Film Revolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/laying-the-groundwork-15-basic-shots-every-director-needs-for-2024/"><u>Laying the Groundwork  15 Basic Shots Every Director Needs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-contacts-from-infinix-note-30-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to recover deleted contacts from Infinix Note 30 Pro.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-vivo-y55s-5g-2023-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-easy-alteration-rotate-film-frames-with-vlc-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Easy Alteration  Rotate Film Frames with VLC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/streaming-and-saving-games-on-xbox-one/"><u>Streaming and Saving Games on Xbox One</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

How to Record Video on PS4 with Capture Card"></a>Way 3. How to Record Video on PS4 with Capture Card</h2><p>If you do not want to install a PS4 emulator on your computer, you can purchase a capture card to connect your PS4 to your computer. Your computer screen will literally turn into a TV screen which you use to play on PS4. This does not make the gameplay lag, which is a common case when you use PS4 emulator to stream gameplay on PS4. In order to record your gameplay with Capture Card, you can use any screen recorder. In fact, there are some capture cards that have inbuilt screen recorder. Here are the steps to follow for gameplay recording PS4 using Capture card.</p><p>Step 1: Connect PS4, capture card and your computer through HDMI cable.</p><p>Step 2: The USB or data cable should go from Capture card to your computer. The PS4 should be connected to your TV.</p><p>Step 3: Turn on PS4 and go to Settings on your TV screen. From Settings, go to System&gt; System Information to check if PS4 software is updated. This is to ensure that what you see on your TV screen should also be on your laptop.</p><p>Step 4: On your computer, you can use any online screen recorder. If you have any inbuilt screen recorder that comes with your capture card, you can use the same. Start your gameplay and start recording on your computer.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record videos on PS4. If your gameplay is less than 60 minutes most of the time, you can do the recording with PS4 default screen recorder. However, for professional recording of your gameplay, we recommend you use Filmora to record gameplay on PSA via your computer. You can edit any part of the video and add transitions and video efforts to make it more eye-catching.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-15-game-recording-software-expert-reviews-for-gamers-delight-for-2024/"><u>[New] 15 Game Recording Software  Expert Reviews for Gamers' Delight for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-windows-1110-screenshot-and-recorders-ranked/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Essential Windows 11/10 Screenshot & Recorders Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-the-world-of-online-discussion-mastering-zoom-chat-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating the World of Online Discussion  Mastering Zoom Chat Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/omnivision-hdwebcamcapture-for-2024/"><u>OmniVision HDWebCamCapture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/elevating-ppt-impact-through-high-quality-recordings/"><u>Elevating PPT Impact Through High-Quality Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-efficient-scheduling-techniques-for-effective-google-meeting-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Efficient Scheduling Techniques for Effective Google Meeting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-streaming-quality-comparison-obs-against-shadowplay-for-2024/"><u>[New] Streaming Quality Comparison  OBS Against ShadowPlay for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/your-complete-guide-to-reset-realme-narzo-n55-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Your Complete Guide To Reset Realme Narzo N55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-taming-audio-chaos-advanced-tips-and-tricks-for-reducing-room-noise-in-microphones/"><u>In 2024, Taming Audio Chaos Advanced Tips and Tricks for Reducing Room Noise in Microphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/um-7-dslr-picks-for-ultimate-visual-storytelling-online/"><u>Premium 7 DSLR Picks For Ultimate Visual Storytelling Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-masterclass-constructing-mc-village-houses-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Masterclass  Constructing MC Village Houses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-on-samsung-galaxy-a05withwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Samsung Galaxy A05with/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamerease-screen-recording-on-win11/"><u>2024 Approved  StreamerEase  Screen Recording on Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-mp4-music-a-collection-of-streamlined-audio-extraction-procedures-set-for-2024/"><u>Updated Mastering MP4 Music A Collection of Streamlined Audio Extraction Procedures Set for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-the-art-of-reshaping-your-tiktok-avatar/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unveiling the Art of Reshaping Your TikTok Avatar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-vanguard-of-anime-character-dubbing-standout-performers/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Vanguard of Anime Character Dubbing Standout Performers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

Running a session online can be a daunting task - with the right tools, information, and resources it can be smooth sailing. There are three main video conferencing apps available, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and an app that trumps them all - Google Meet.</p><p>Google Meet is a video calling app that comes fully equipped with numerous features, such as screen presenting. If you are looking to perfect your hand on Google Meet, then read through this comprehensive guide on <strong>how to present ppt in Google Meet</strong>!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Present PowerPoint Presentations in Google Meet on Laptop</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Present Google Slides in Google Meet on Laptop</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet On iPhone and iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Stop Presenting PPT on Google Meet</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-Presentations-in-Google-Meet-on-Laptop"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-Presentations-in-Google-Meet-on-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Present PowerPoint Presentations in Google Meet on Laptop"></a>Part 1: How to Present PowerPoint Presentations in Google Meet on Laptop</h2><p>With remote working on the rise, Google Meet enables users to showcase and share PowerPoint slides during online meetings and sessions. Whether it is a meeting, online class, or brainstorming session, it becomes a whole lot easier with a PowerPoint slideshow - bringing everyone on the same page!</p><p>You must be wondering <strong>how to share ppt in Google Meet</strong>, well the process is fairly simple and extremely functional. You will only need two tools to execute this screen-sharing process, a web browser, and Microsoft PowerPoint. We would advise that you use Google Chrome as your web browser as it works best with Google Meet.</p><p>Just a heads up, when you are presenting your screen on Google Meet, everyone can see what you display, so it’s best to open up your PowerPoint slides before joining the meeting so there are no surprises!</p><ol><li>Open the Microsoft PowerPoint Slides on your laptop, the model or brand of the laptop does not matter, as long as you have Microsoft PowerPoint on it</li><li>Convert your slides from the default mode to browsed by an individual mode. If you have used Microsoft PowerPoint before, then you must know that in slideshow mode the slides appear in fullscreen making it difficult to switch between applications, therefore by converting the PowerPoint it will be windowed fullscreen, allowing the presenter to switch between applications. The process is simple, just click the “Slide Show” tab, then “Set Up Slide Show”, and from the drop-down menu press “Browsed by an Individual”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerpoint-browsed-by-individual.jpg"                      alt="set PowerPoint to individual browse"                ></p><ol><li>After setting up the PowerPoint slides, move over to Google Meet and join the meeting through the meeting link provided or schedule in a new meeting. You have two options: either you can join the meeting and then share your slides, or share the PowerPoint while joining the session. If you decide to go with the second option, you must click “Present now” and continue with the steps below.</li><li>To share your <strong>Google Meet PPT presentation</strong> just click the “Present Now” button on the bottom right-hand side of the screen.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-present-now.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet Present Now"                ></p><p>There you will see two options and must click one of the following options,</p><ul><li>Your entire screen - if you would like to share your entire screen, this means any application which you see, other participants in the meeting will see as well</li><li>A window - this allows the presenter to share only one selected window in the meeting (this option is advised)</li><li>A tab - this is best for presenting a video or animations, not a PowerPoint <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-present-now-options.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet Present Now Options"                ></li></ul><ol><li>If the presenter decides to go with the “A Window” option then click the window that shows your PowerPoint slides then select share.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-powerpoint-on-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share PPT on Google Meet"                ></p><p>The slideshow will automatically start to broadcast to viewers.

The process is quite similar to that of sharing a PowerPoint, but there are a few changes.</p><p>So to answer your question on <strong>how to present slide in Google Meet</strong>,</p><ol><li>Open up your Google Slides, go over to the Google Slides webpage and browse to find the slides you have prepared.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-slides-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet"                ></p><ol><li>Open Google Meet on your browser and go on to the meeting link page. Here you have two options, one - you can join the session directly and then start presenting the screen, or two - share the screen and then join the session.</li></ol><p>If you decide to go with the latter option, then click the “Present” option. Since I’m using the Chrome browser, I will choose the slides tab to share. If you would like to share any audio, make sure to tick the share tab audio button as well!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-slides-tab-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet"                ></p><ol><li>Once you have gone through these steps your Google Slides will automatically be visible to anyone and everyone in the Google Meet session.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-On-iPhone-and-iPad"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-On-iPhone-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet On iPhone and iPad?"></a>Part 3: How to Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet On iPhone and iPad?</h2><p>Wondering <strong>how to present ppt in Google Meet in iPhone</strong>? Well, don’t worry because even with a mobile or tablet you can access all the Google Meet features, even screen share!</p><p>Step 1) Open your PowerPoint or Slides on your iPhone or iPad, and then join the Google Meet meeting.</p><p>Step 2) To start sharing your screen, press the three-button icon which appears in the bottom right corner of your screen, and then tap the <strong>Share Screen</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-powerpoint-on-google-meet-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet on iPhone"                ></p><p> Step 3) After doing so, the presenter will see a notification on their screen allowing them to broadcast their entire screen. Upon clicking “Start Broadcast” the screen will start to share in three seconds. Switch from Google Meet to PowerPoint or Google Slides and the screen will automatically share slides.</p><p>To be sure if the screen is being shared check the top of the iPhone or iPad and if there is a red stripe, it means the screen is being broadcasted to participants. Moreover, do not worry while switching apps, you will still be in the Google Meet session even if you go onto PowerPoint or Google Slides while sharing your screen on a mobile or tablet device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-broadcast-share-powerpoint-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet on iPhone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Presenting-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-on-Android"><a href="#Part-4-Presenting-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Presenting PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet on Android"></a>Part 4: Presenting PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet on Android</h2><p>The process of presenting a PowerPoint or Google Slides during a Google Meet session on an android is very similar to that of an Apple device.</p><p>Step 1) You must open up your PowerPoint or Slides beforehand, while this is not necessary, it always makes the process more simple.</p><p>Step 2) Join into the Google Meet session, if you have been invited into the session then join using the joining link, if not then create a new meeting. If you would rather directly screen share instead of joining into the session first, then click the “Share Screen” option directly.</p><p>Step 3) Upon joining the meeting, click the “More” option and tap the “Present Screen” menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-screen-on-google-meet-android.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet on Android"                ></p><p>Step 4) After that, allow presenting and go to your PowerPoint &#x2F; Google Slides to share them with participants, easy right?! Remember, participants can pause your screen presentation and start presenting their screen in between, as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Stop-Presenting-PPT-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Stop-Presenting-PPT-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Stop Presenting PPT on Google Meet?"></a>Part 5: How to Stop Presenting PPT on Google Meet?</h2><p>All good things must come to an end, just like wrapping up a productive PowerPoint work session on Google Meet. When a presenter is done sharing their PowerPoint slides they must stop sharing their screen as well. One easy way to do that is to leave the Google Meet session, however, that might not be so polite.</p><p>Instead, there is another way, upon finishing the discussion on the PowerPoint slides, click the stop presenting button which automatically appears on the bottom of the screen you are sharing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-powerpoint-sharing-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="stop PPT sharing on Google Meet"                ></p><p>If that option is not visible to the presenter, they can return to their Google Meet session, and click the stop sharing button as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-google-meet-present.jpg"                      alt="stop  Google Meet present"                ></p><p>Moreover, if you are on an iPhone or iPad, you can simply click the red stripe on the top of your screen and a notification popup will appear indicating that you can stop presenting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-powerpoint-present-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="stop  PPT present on Google Meet"                ></p><h2 id="FAQ-about-Presenting-PowerPoint-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#FAQ-about-Presenting-PowerPoint-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="FAQ about Presenting PowerPoint on Google Meet"></a>FAQ about Presenting PowerPoint on Google Meet</h2><ol><li><strong>Can others see you while you are presenting a PPT?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, if you have enabled the video option during the Google Meet session, then participants will be able to see you. Just because an individual starts presenting, their camera will not turn off automatically, unless it is turned off by them.</p><ol><li><strong>Can participants interact with your device while sharing a presentation?</strong></li></ol><p>No, participants cannot interact with your device while sharing a presentation. The screen is only being mirrored, therefore only the presenter has control over the device. Participants can only view it, not control the device.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you present when someone else is presenting?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, an individual can present when someone else is presenting. If you start presenting while someone else is already presenting, their screen presenting will pause and yours will start.</p><p><strong>Are You Ready to Present PPT on Google Meet?</strong></p><p>Presenting a ppt on Google Meet is not all that difficult, if you know what to do, how to do it, and when to do it, then you are good to go.

However, it’ll be much better if you can share that fantastic experience with the rest of the globe, right? In the end, game recording software may let you do just that. It doesn’t matter whether you’re playing Minecraft or a shooting game; being able to share your knowledge with a large group of people is always impressive. Furthermore, the cycle has become much easier for players as a result of the accelerating innovation. You may record a full-screen continuing interaction at 60 frames per second with Gecata by Movavi and save it as an MP4 movie with recommended configurations for YouTube transmission.</p><p>Gecata is a good and maybe the best option for Windows users looking for a lightweight but very functional game recording program. It also ensures a single tick, which is a slack-free action that enables you to broadcast and record at the same time. Individual hotkeys are included, allowing you to explore your game without being interrupted. It also allows you to capture videos in 4K at 120 frames per second, which is rather impressive for a gadget of this sort. Add sound from speakers and a mouthpiece to your interaction accounts, as well as webcam video, so you can share your emotions with viewers when you upload the video to YouTube or another video-sharing platform.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Gecata-Recorder’s-Highlights"><a href="#Part-1-Gecata-Recorder’s-Highlights" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Gecata Recorder’s Highlights"></a>Part 1: Gecata Recorder’s Highlights</h2><p>The Gecata game recorder comes with a free trial version, after which you can purchase the complete version for a reasonable price. The stage’s UI makes it simple to remove the unwanted content from the streams.</p><p><strong>Obtain Sound and Microphone for the Game:</strong></p><p>This Movavi game capture program allows for two-way solid capture of in-game audio files, music, and speech, as well as mouthpiece yield. You may comment on the activity as you go using Gecata by Movavi. Save sound streams as individual sound documents so you may remove bloopers without destroying the movie.</p><p><strong>Speed of Transfer:</strong></p><p>Make your videos more easily available on YouTube in HD by saving them in MP4 with the recommended parameters. Upload your video evidence on YouTube. Gecata by Movavi has improved the catch design by using YouTube suggestions, allowing you to manage your HD recordings in minutes.</p><p><strong>Following the Production:</strong></p><p>Save game footage, webcam video, and sound analysis as separate documents so you may remove bloopers without ruining your playthroughs. When you’re finished, you’ll have the choice of viewing the video in MP4, a format supported by most devices and recommended for transmission by YouTube.</p><p><strong>Sources of Information:</strong></p><p>You may use Gecata from Movavi to overlay webcam video over the game footage. Choose the size and location of the webcam window, or save it as a separate video track for further customization. Use these to quickly create expressions and statements.</p><p><strong>Screenshots to Capture:</strong></p><p>Many players like transferring screenshots of their current engagement to provide a basic notion about the video’s content and the genuine qualities of the game being played. The customer may take screen screenshots while the video is being recorded using this product.</p><p><strong>Execution:</strong></p><p>Before uploading the video to any stage, the product allows you to easily edit, convert, and adjust the file size, bit rate, outlining rate, and other characteristics of the video. The device may record and encode video up to multiple times faster when used in conjunction with NVIDIA NVENC and Intel HD Graphics equipment performance increases.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Gecata-to-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Gecata-to-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games"></a>Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games</h2><p>Movavi Gecata is a relatively new continuing interaction recording program that costs just $19.95 and has all of the features that gamers want. PC games are more well-known than they have ever been, and players are eager to document their interactions. Some people have to transmit to their friends, while some do it professionally as Twitch or YouTube decorations. Regardless of the intended use, make sure you think about Gecata in light of the surrounding reality of interest.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download and install Gecata by Movavi</strong></p><p>After the download is complete, launch the.exe file and follow the Installation Wizard’s instructions. It will just take a few seconds to finish the interaction. When it’s finished, open the program and capture whatever gameplay footage you need.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Modify the Capture Options</strong></p><p>Make sure the Capture mode in the main window is set to Game. The noises of the framework will be picked up on their own. If you need to capture your voice and face while you’re playing, enable the Microphone and Webcam on the Devices page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Take a video of the game</strong></p><p>If you need to start recording after dispatching the game, click Start Recording in the application interface before starting the game; otherwise, start the game you want to record. To start or stop recording, use F10, and to stop, press F9. You don’t need to do anything; the game film will be stored on your hard disk as an MP4 file as a result. This is how to record games on a computer, and it couldn’t be much easier!</p><p><strong>Step 4: Save your Gameplay</strong></p><p>Change the Video quality slider to choose the output video quality. Note that high-quality game footage will take up a lot of space on your computer, so make sure you have at least 2 or 3 GB of free space before you start filming. Simply click the Capture distinct streams box to save the screen capture and camera recordings as separate documents.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Pros and Cons"></a>Part 3: Pros and Cons</h2><p>Gecata supports a variety of codecs, makes use of NVIDIA and Intel hardware acceleration, and can record 4K video at up to 120 frames per second. Because the audio streams are saved independently, it’s simple to cut out any bloopers without disrupting the in-game audio.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Side-by-side recording and streaming</li><li>Record gaming movies at up to 120 frames per second</li><li>Take notes on everything that happens in the game, including the sound effects and your voice.</li><li>4K video recording with Various video formats</li><li>Overlay a camera into your outstanding gameplay</li><li>Record both the games and your voice</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Watermarks on recordings in the free version</li><li>Lags with intensive games like Call of Duty and Shutter Games</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Software-to-Gecata-to-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Software-to-Gecata-to-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Alternative Software to Gecata to Record Games"></a>Part 4: Alternative Software to Gecata to Record Games</h2><p>Even though Gecata allows you to broadcast and record at the same time, it’s simple to overlay your camera and manage everything using hotkeys so you don’t have to interrupt the interaction. The user interface is simple, yet it’s functional and easy to navigate. You may record any game in 4K ultra-HD resolution, whether it’s a 2D or 3D game.

Whatever you want to record, whether it’s gaming, web player videos, continuing commentary, music, or anything else.</p><p>Furthermore, since the finest games are found on Windows PCs, the best screen recorder for games will almost always be Windows PC software. Filmora, on the other hand, is accessible for the two phases in the event of an incident. Filmora allows you to record the whole screen, a specific location, your camera, or even just a small zone around your mouse, and it outputs in all of the major formats, including MP4. The implicit manager allows you to add text, lines, call-outs, and other on-screen elements, which is useful if you want to create an educational exercise rather than merely record your continuing interaction.

It can be done, we promise! We took a look to try and explain this one a little further after we found out that not everyone knows how it all works.</p><p>WhatsApp is one of our favorite communication apps, especially useful while we are all stuck at home in shelter of the virus.

Skype Online"></a>1. Skype Online</h3><p>Skype is one of the longest-running video calling and web calling apps. It gives you a local international ID to make long-distance calls for free, and much easier. It also has some great functions if you need to work from home or video conference. Skype has excellent customer support and some wonderful add-ons to make the experience more accessible. When it comes to a tailored, professional finish, then Skype has the most experience. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record Skype video call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype.JPG"                      alt="Skype"                ></p><h3 id="2-Google-Duo"><a href="#2-Google-Duo" class="headerlink" title="2. Google Duo"></a>2. Google Duo</h3><p>If you can’t figure out how to make video calls on WhatsApp Web on laptops, then Google Duo is a brilliant alternative. It allows HD video and audio chat while working with low bandwidth or bad Wi-Fi. It’s fully compatible with all things made by Google – and it works by signing into your Google account, so your friends don’t need to do very much if you invite them to a call.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-duo-app.JPG"                      alt="Google Duo"                ></p><h3 id="3-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#3-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Messenger"></a>3. Facebook Messenger</h3><p>If you don’t intend to do much in the way of group chatting, then video calling in Messenger is a reliable way to see friends during the lockdown. Most people have Facebook, it will work with all their products, and it is as easy to join as clicking a link. The downside is that it only works if FB knows who you are. If you closed your account with them, then you will need to start from scratch. That being said, audio and video are both clear, you can add in file sharing, and you have the option to instant message at all times.

In this game, the goal is to destroy the opposing team’s “Nexus,” which is the core of their base. Windows and macOS are the operating systems that support this game. Two teams of five players are formed in this team-based strategy game. A point called ‘Nexus’ marks the starting point of each team’s journey.</p><p>Many game enthusiasts are addicted to playing LOL. They record their funny videos, share their gameplay achievements, and earn money by sharing on video-sharing sites and other social media sites. Gamers can use it to find out how a game is played. The gameplay presents different elements of the game. A player can see the game’s battlefield and fighting strategies in action.</p><p>After watching the gameplay, viewers will have a better understanding of the game. It will be clear to them what the basics are, what the scenes look like, and how the strategies work. Viewers will learn how to play. Having this information will be of great assistance to game players. It will become clear what they should do at certain points in the game. Gameplay videos offer a walkthrough of parts of the game where players might get stuck. In this case, the gamer will become more familiar with the game and its strategies.

You can also download it separately. A replay button will appear after your match has ended. You can click on this button to watch the replay of your match, and you can also download the replay and save it to your device if you want to. In our opinion, it is the best and most convenient way to record your gameplay because, in this case, you don’t need to download any software separately. Everything is built-in here.

All methods have their own benefits and drawbacks. If you want our opinion on which method is the best among these three, we recommend you go with Filmora. It is because it is an all-in-one program.

You can record your videos and edit them at the same time using this program and share them directly on Youtube and other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-leading-non-profit-software-for-video-snippets/"><u>[New] Leading Non-Profit Software for Video Snippets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/decoding-fraps-video-capturing-techniques/"><u>Decoding Fraps Video Capturing Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-thriving-in-zoom-chats-key-techniques-for-engaging-online-conversations-for-2024/"><u>[New] Thriving in Zoom Chats  Key Techniques for Engaging Online Conversations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/pro-tips-for-immediate-use-of-io-screen-recorder/"><u>Pro Tips for Immediate Use of IO Screen Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-dynamic-windows-top-9-essential-gif-recorder-programs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Dynamic Windows  Top 9 Essential GIF Recorder Programs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-screen-saving-android-titles-a-curated-list-of-indoor-games/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Screen-Saving Android Titles  A Curated List of Indoor Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-zooms-best-alternatives-on-laptops-and-tablets/"><u>[New] Zoom's Best Alternatives on Laptops & Tablets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-recording-on-googles-platform/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Recording on Google's Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-precision-video-capture-experts/"><u>[New] In 2024, Precision Video Capture Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-the-rhythm-of-the-room-mac-audio-guide/"><u>[New] The Rhythm of the Room  Mac Audio Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/in-2024-premium-4k-action-cameras-our-elite-seven-list/"><u>In 2024, Premium 4K Action Cameras  Our Elite Seven List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-unveil-your-channels-potential-with-30-top-tier-free-intros/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unveil Your Channel's Potential with 30 Top-Tier Free Intros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/quickly-skip-through-tiktok-clips/"><u>Quickly Skip Through TikTok Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/simple-ways-to-get-lost-files-back-from-vivo-y78-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>Simple ways to get lost files back from Vivo Y78 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/is-gsm-flasher-adb-legit-full-review-to-bypass-your-tecno-phantom-v-flipfrp-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Is GSM Flasher ADB Legit?

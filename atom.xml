    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Valheim’s-Optimal-Seed-Selection-Strategies"><a href="#Valheim’s-Optimal-Seed-Selection-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Valheim’s Optimal Seed Selection Strategies"></a>Valheim’s Optimal Seed Selection Strategies</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-poster.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-poster"                ></p><p>Before we delve into Valheim seeds and essential things to note, it is vital to understand the Valheim game first. Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Valheim-Seeds"><a href="#The-Best-Valheim-Seeds" class="headerlink" title="The Best Valheim Seeds"></a><strong>The Best Valheim Seeds</strong></h2><p>Since each seed will create a different world from the other worlds, you must check our list to find the best Valheim seeds for mining or speedrunners.</p><p> <em>“Note: The seed you select should be in direct line with your preferences in the game. ”</em></p><p>The Valheim players can use their world seeds to enter a world that has well-known challenges and layouts. Every world in this game gets a unique seed code for players to move around quickly. With the seed codes, players can keep notes of every saved world that they create.</p><p>Some of the best Valheim seeds include:</p><h3 id="1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K"><a href="#1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K" class="headerlink" title="1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K"></a>1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-1.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-1"                ></p><p>Since you may want your private Island far away from everything you know, this seed is the ideal one to plant. Aside from trying to get far away, the biomes in Valheim are filled with horrible creatures that can appear at your base whenever they like and destroy everything.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the seed you know for those who want a piece of land free from any monstrous atrocities. You will spawn it on a small island in the middle of the sea. And, the nearest boss here is Eikthyr. With such a seed, your inner Viking can be aligned with you to build a ship and sail further with plans on discovering newer lands.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt"><a href="#2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt" class="headerlink" title="2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt"></a>2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-2.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-2"                ></p><p>It is regarded as the ideal seed for the speedrunners in Valheim. Players in this world seed can spawn within a starter island with roughly four runes, close by traders and nearby bosses. The biomes here are in a distinct starter continent, plus the fifth boss can be likened to be as close as a raft that skips away. This seed is the perfect realm for the players that want to speedrun their game. While this world comes with four bosses, Haldor is on the Island as well. More so, players will find the fifth boss on a neighboring island.</p><h3 id="3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4"><a href="#3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4" class="headerlink" title="3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4"></a>3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-3.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-3"                ></p><p>Even if you think that you are the best in Valheim, you will need to learn how to build a ship to sail and discover materials and biomes. If you never knew, sailing does have a learning curve. First of all, you will need to get the necessary ingredients to make a vessel; then, the next thing is to learn the difference between the three boat types available and how to use the wind on your side.</p><p> <em>“Note: the boat types are Karve, longship, and raft. ”</em></p><p>While in the water, it is advisable to look out for horrifying serpents that dwell in the ocean. Though some players do not want to bother themselves with sailing, the ideal seed for you will be oV5BZHkqY4.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4708689&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Win： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Seed-maypoleplz"><a href="#4-Seed-maypoleplz" class="headerlink" title="4.Seed: maypoleplz"></a>4.Seed: maypoleplz</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-4.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-4"                ></p><p>In such a game that concentrates on surviving and crafting, all the help you need will be gotten. To help the amateur players, developers of Valheim added a unique yet rare structure to the game.</p><p>This structure is known as Maypole. It is furniture that is made available only to some Valheim world seeds. The players themselves cannot craft these Valheim seeds.</p><p>With the seed mapoleplz, you will be capable of spawning in a world that has Maypole lying towards the west. It simply means that if you construct a base around the structure, your character will be getting extra comfort when resting here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Seed-t9n3WG6dFk"><a href="#5-Seed-t9n3WG6dFk" class="headerlink" title="5.Seed: t9n3WG6dFk"></a>5.Seed: t9n3WG6dFk</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-5.png"                      alt="valheim-seeds-5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Since Iron is among the best resources one can find in the Valheim game, it must be understood that it is hard to come by. There are so many things the players will need to do to access Iron.</p><p> <em>“Note: Iron is made available only in the Swamp biome. ”</em></p><p>Nevertheless, immediately you unlock the scrap Iron, you can quickly drop it in the smelter to process Iron. Then, you can begin creating weapons and your armor. More so, for those interested in Iron farming, seed t9n3WG6dFk is among the Valheim seeds that have a vast Swamp biome wholly filled with sunken crypts. You can easily explore these crypts and the muddy scrap piles that are prepared to be mined. Bear in mind that before you get to work, ensure that your wishbone is equipped. The wishbone will help in quickly finding the muddy scrap piles.</p><h3 id="6-Seed-42069lolxd"><a href="#6-Seed-42069lolxd" class="headerlink" title="6.Seed: 42069lolxd"></a>6.Seed: 42069lolxd</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-6.png"                      alt="valheim-seeds-6"                ></p><p>For those unaware, Haldor is a merchant of Valheim. When searching for the best Valheim seeds, this is the ideal seed you will need if you want to trade with Haldor. With this seed, you will be in a world where Haldor is very close to the point of spawning. You just need to head towards the east from the spawn point and follow the south coast. Then, you are to cross the water until you arrive at the black forest biome. When you find Haldor, you can use your coins to buy items like a yule hat, fishing rod, and anything else.</p><p>You can sell things to Haldor as well. These things could be rubies, silver necklaces, or even Amber. You can engage in selling things in exchange for coins.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>It is worthy to note that we have provided you with a full description of some of the best Valheim seeds.

In the past, <strong>recording internal audio</strong> in Android is severely restricted by Google. However, KitKat version of Android OS has finally enabled Android Smartphone users to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record the screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on their devices, but recording the clear and perfect internal audio is not an easy job because of the Android OS policy that screen recording apps are not given the permission to record the internal sound of the Android phone or tablet after Android Lollipop version, recording the internal sound through microphone is a solution. Still, it picks up background noise while screen capturing is in progress.</p><p>So, how to create an internal audio recording on your Android devices? While in this article, I will show you 4 different ways in the following 3 Parts to record your gameplay video with internal audio recording on Android phones or tablets without root.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Record-system-internal-audio-with-Android-screen-recording-apps"><a href="#Part-1-Record-system-internal-audio-with-Android-screen-recording-apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps"></a>Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps</h2><p>For a long time, the only way to record the internal audio with an Android Smartphone was through the device’s external microphone. This method of recording audio had many downsides, including poor audio quality and capturing of distracting background noises.</p><p>There are several different ways in which you can record system audio and avoid producing screen recordings with terrible sound. Each of the methods includes using third-party apps or screen capturing devices, since Android Lollipop and later versions of the Android OS, still don’t offer an effective solution to this problem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="1.

At the same time, it also allows its users to record only sound produced by their Smartphones during the screen recording session. You can download this app for free on the Google Play store, but if you choose to install it on your Android phone, you should arm yourself with patience since this app contains ads.</p><p>After you’ve successfully installed Mobizen Screen Recorder on your Android Smartphone, you should launch the app and look for the Settings gear icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Tap on the Sound option, and before proceeding any further, you should make sure that Sound is enabled. Once you allow the Sound feature, you’ll be able to see the Options menu that offers External and Internal features. By selecting the Internal option, you will instruct the app to record only the sound produced by the gameplay of the video game you are recording or a YouTube video you’re playing while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The result you will get is the crystal clear audio in your screen recording, but Mobizen app performs well <strong>only with Samsung and LG Android phones</strong>, so if you have an Android device from some other manufacturer, this app may underperform.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254549&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/8_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2.

Once the installation is complete, launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. This app won’t record sound until you enable this option, which is the reason why you should locate the Record Audio feature in the Settings menu.</p><p>At this point, you should exit the app, and click on the AZ bubble on the side of your Smartphone’s screen. Tap on the Record icon to start the screen recording session and proceed to perform all actions you wanted to capture with your Android device. The audio will be recorded simultaneously with the video. When ready, slide down the notification bar, and stop the screen recording session.</p><p>In order to extract the audio file, you’ll have to transfer the screen recording you made with AZ Screen Recorder to a PC and perform this action with a video editing software. You may have to create several screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen before you get the perfect audio because the device’s microphone is going to capture all sound it can pick up, both external and internal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698824&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3pro-screenshot-homepage.png"                      border="0"                >PCDJ DEX 3 for Windows &amp; MAC is the total entertainment DJ software solution, offering audio, video, and karaoke mixing ability.

Professionals often use capture cards, despite their prices, simply because they enable them to record high-quality screen recordings, create live streams, and record internal audio from any device they are connected to, including Android Smartphones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-capture-card.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC with capture card"                ></p><p>Most capture cards are equipped with their own screen recording software, so the process of adjusting the video and audio settings depends on the capture card you have.

However, if you want to use the Elgato, you need to make sure that your PC is compatible with this capture card, and you’ll have to connect your Android Smartphone with this device.</p><p>Using capture cards to record a screen on your Smartphone may be too expensive since capture cards are frequently used as a part of the professional gaming equipment used for streaming or capturing gameplay from games on Xbox or PS4.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator"></a>Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</h2><p>Although this may not be the simplest way to record internal audio on your Smartphone device, it is probably the best solution if you want to create high-resolution screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen and professional internal audio recordings at the same time.</p><p>Before you can start a recording session you must first install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC. This software can be used for the production of high-quality screen recordings of your desktop, and it also offers excellent audio recording options.</p><p>Furthermore, you are going to need an Android emulator, an app that sends the pictures from your Android’s screen to a bigger screen, connected to your Android device. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.bignox.com/" >Nox App Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will enable you to run the apps you want to record on your PC. There is a recording feature in the NOxPlayer Emulator, while the Bandicam software can be used to capture your desktop activities, as well as the system audio during a screen recording session. So, it is recommended to use both Bandicam and NoxPlayer to record audio in the video from Android phone on PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-games-pc-noxplayer.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This method of recording internal audio on an Android device is best used if you want to create high-resolution audio recordings that can later be edited and used in the final cut of the screen recording you produced with Bandicam software and the Nox App Player.</p><p>That’s the way that we figured out about how to record the internal sound on your Android phones and tablets.

So, if someone has started sharing the screen on your turn or there is some error, you can send a signal to the participant by sharing your screen during their presentation.</p><p>Thus, Google Meet does not restrict other members from sharing screens when already one screen is shared.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Sonic-Sanctuary-The-Mac-Experience"><a href="#Sonic-Sanctuary-The-Mac-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Sonic Sanctuary: The Mac Experience"></a>Sonic Sanctuary: The Mac Experience</h2><p>Sound Studio is one of the industry-leading audio recording software that has millions of downloads over different app stores and platforms. The application is specifically designed to match the high performance of MacBooks with the macOS support. The interface inside the application is handy with a bunch of tools for utilizing every aspect of sound recording. With Sound Studio you will feel almost like sitting in a record room with professional hardware.</p><p>The app even lets you digitalize any of the records from tapes as well as vinyl records and also lets you record any live performances that are going on with high-quality audio output. The equalizer in the application has dozens of features that will allow you to mix any of your recordings with background tracks, voice-overs, and many more digital effects. Here’s more about it:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio"></a>Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for powerful recording software that can give you industry-leading features, then Sound Studio is the best choice for you. It is specifically designed to provide an ultimate user experience with fewer complications and the highest quality output. And with the new updated version from Sound Studio, you will have even more functions on your lap. The following are some of the best features of the Sound Studio application:</p><p><strong>1. High-quality music output</strong></p><p>One of the basic requirements for any audio recorder is that the output quality for the recorded files must be crystal clear and shouldn’t be of low quality. And Sound Studio meets all these aspects in voice recording by providing its users HD quality output sounds with simple and easy steps.</p><p><strong>2. Multiple formats support</strong></p><p>The application is also enabled with multiple audio format supports which means that there are several formats in which you can create your record as well as export it. You can work with voice recordings from MP3 or M4A files and then you can save them in different formats such as AIDD and WAV.</p><p><strong>3. Fast and convenient editing</strong></p><p>The user interface along with the software integration of macOS gives Sound Studio a very fast yet convenient editing studio feature. In this section, you will be able to create your audio in several layers and save it with different digital effects such as reverb, delays, chorus, or even flange filters.</p><p><strong>4. Digital conversion</strong></p><p>The application also allows the users to visit their memory lane by helping them digitize the tapes as well as vinyl records from their PC itself. In this way, everyone can save their old dusty records into digital formats which will enable them to modify the voice configurations and then edit them with different layers of effects.</p><p><strong>5. Batch processing using AppleScript or Automator</strong></p><p>For people who want to process their audio in a batch or want to combine different audio recordings at the same time, they can use the AppleScript or any Automator for the same since Sound Studio supports the integration of both thus enabling a more powerful part of audio processing.</p><p><strong>6. Live performance recording</strong></p><p>There are situations where we want to record the ongoing live performances from our systems and in such scenarios, Sound Studio can help you efficiently. With built-in live recording mode, you can record the live performances from voice actors almost instantly with the push of a few buttons on your system.</p><p><strong>7. Digital noise cancellation</strong></p><p>The application also cancels out the extra and unnecessary voices from the background after you record any voice in the Sound Studio. Thus, when you play it with enabling the digital noise cancellation feature, you will be able to listen to clear sound without any disruption from the outside world.</p><p><strong>8. Regular updates</strong></p><p>Updates are the most important things for any software since the developers provide a clean experience with each new update and try to remove the bugs and issues reported by users. Also, Sound Studio developers provide regular updates to all their users with just a one-time subscription.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-with-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-with-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This article is meant for you if that’s the case!</p><p>The days of buying dedicated handheld consoles to fulfill entertainment needs on the go are long gone. The Gameboy, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Sony’s PSP were the most commonly used gaming consoles a decade ago. As times change, we increasingly rely on our smartphones for a variety of activities. Smartphones are now so powerful that they can replace laptops and desktop computers because of their chipsets. Gaming on the go is by far the most intriguing development of smartphones.</p><p>Nintendo 3DS is certainly at the top of the list of most popular handheld gaming consoles, perhaps alongside the PSP and Gameboy. It is undeniable that the Nintendo 3DS has some of the greatest classic games of all time, and one can totally understand why people might be tempted to pick one up - even in 2024. Since our smartphones are easily accessible, buying a new device just to play games that are already available would be a waste of resources. Using emulators, you are able to play games developed for other hardware on your phone.</p><p>If you search on google for the best 3DS emulators for Android, you will have limitless options, and you can easily get confused among so many choices, such as RetroArch, DraStic DS Emulator, NDS4droid, etc. We are lending you a helping hand as we have prepared a list of top 10 3ds emulators that you can use on your android smartphones and have the classic gaming experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

RetroArch’s only drawback is that its features are a bit advanced for new users, making it a bit difficult to get used to.

We will help you out in your decision making by providing a thorough comparison of OBS vs Streamlabs parameter by parameter.</p><h2 id="1-About-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-About-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. About OBS Studio"></a>1. About OBS Studio</h2><p>Here are all the details of OBS Studio that you will help you compare OBS with Streamlabs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-pros-and-cons.jpg"                      alt="obs pros and cons"                ></p><p>Performance:</p><p>OBS Studio is designed for multi-tasking. You can live stream as well as record your video. You can capture your screen as well as webcam video simultaneously. In fact, it supports capturing video from various external devices. For regular video recording and streaming, the performance of OBS is top-notch. It does not affect the performance of your streaming or gameplay.</p><p>However, when you have extremely high-quality video playing on your screen or you are playing high-end games that you want to record, OBS Studio tends to consume excessive CPU resources. Therefore, OBS Studio is suitable for regular quality streaming and recording and it might crash if your computer configuration is not top-notch.</p><p>Recording:</p><p>If you are comparing OBS vs Streamlabs for recording, OBS is a clear winner. This is because OBS Studio heavily focuses on recording features while Streamlabs focuses on live streaming broadly. You can record video from any external device, you can modify recording quality, and you can switch between multiple scenes as required. It also comes with filters for color correction, chroma key, and masking for better recording.</p><p>Streaming:</p><p>OBS Studio is the most popular live streaming platform and this is due to its wide compatibility. Once you have Stream URL and Stream key, you can literally stream on any and all online platforms that allow live streaming. Starting from Twitch, YouTube and Facebook to even Instagram and Twitter, you can stream on all popular and not-so-popular platforms directly from your desktop.</p><p>Ease Of Use:</p><p>OBS can be a bit complicated to use for beginners. This is because the user interface is not as clean and intuitive as you would expect. However, once you start using the software for some time, you will get used to the controls and options. But the learning curve is rather steep and that is why many users opt for OBS alternatives. For ease of use, OBS Studio has loads of hotkeys through which you can perform all the different operations instantly.</p><p>Video Quality:</p><p>OBS Studio lets you customize the video quality as per your requirements. You can capture 4K video depending on your screen resolution or camera resolution. However, OBS automatically lowers the frame rate as the resolution of the video goes up which is not desirable. That is why users do not prefer OBS for recording 4K videos and mostly use it for standard, high-definition video quality.</p><h3 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h3><ul><li>Compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</li><li>Wide range of compatibility for live streaming.</li><li>Customizable settings from different specifications.</li><li>Work with multiple scenes and input sources.</li><li>Pushes latest updates for improved performance.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h3><ul><li>Does not have user-friendly interface.</li><li>Excessive CPU usage and frequent crashes.</li><li>Not very suitable for 4K video quality.</li></ul><h2 id="2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop"><a href="#2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="2.

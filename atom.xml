Whether set in a fantasy world, in a Western setting, or in modern times, action-adventure games allow players to embark on an epic journey, regardless of the setting. Here you’ll find some of the best action-adventure games of all time. Fasten your seat belts and get ready to enjoy some fantastic action-adventure games.</p><p>Unfortunately, we could not include all of the greatest video games here due to space limitations, so if your favorite video game isn’t on this list, you shouldn’t be surprised. Despite this, we made sure to include games that would appeal to everyone.</p><h3 id="1-Grand-Theft-Auto-V"><a href="#1-Grand-Theft-Auto-V" class="headerlink" title="1.Grand Theft Auto V"></a>1.Grand Theft Auto V</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/grand-theft-auto-v-poster.jpg"                      alt="grand-theft-auto-v-poster"                ></p><p>Even though it was released in 2013, it is still the most popular game of all time in 2021. Players have always enjoyed a great deal of freedom in GTA games, but GTA V took things to the next level. Whether you want to drive a car, shoot some baddies, fly a helicopter, go to the movies, play golf, or just relax, the possibilities are almost endless.</p><p>The story of Grand Theft Auto V revolves around a group of three characters involved in a plot, which includes major characters such as the Federal Investigation Bureau, the International Affairs Agency, and the Merryweather private army. If you manage to complete the story mode, learn all skills, upgrade and master all weapons, and finish all side missions, the fun never really ends because the online mode is updated constantly and occasionally has events.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• There’s never a dull moment with this engaging and addictive story.</p><p>• A realistic and enormous open-world environment.</p><p>• You can customize tons of weapons in this game.</p><p>• Tons of exclusive multiplayer content continually updated online.</p><h3 id="2-Uncharted-4-A-Thief’s-End"><a href="#2-Uncharted-4-A-Thief’s-End" class="headerlink" title="2.Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End"></a>2.Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uncharted4-a-thiefs-end-poster.jpg"                      alt="uncharted4-a-thiefs-end-poster"                ></p><p>The Uncharted 4 game is an action-packed adventure filled with elements that make a great action title.</p><p>As the Drake brothers hunt for the long-lost pirate treasure, the game tells the story of the brothers and their adventures. As they travel, they will contact dangerous people who will need their help, and they will encounter puzzles that require their sharpest minds to complete. You will be able to explore beautiful locations and enjoy detailed graphics and an excellent narrative to go with the game. It may be disappointing for some that this game is exclusive to PlayStation 4, but if you haven’t played it yet, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to consider picking up the console just for this one title - it’s one of the most popular PS4 games right now.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Adventures involving seasoned treasure hunters provide an addictive storyline.</p><p>• A variety of activities are included, such as climbing, shooting, exploring, and sneaking.</p><p>• Smooth animations and stunning graphics make the game feel very realistic.</p><p>• It features a multiplayer mode for up to ten players and several modes of play.</p><h3 id="3-Mafia-III"><a href="#3-Mafia-III" class="headerlink" title="3.Mafia III"></a>3.Mafia III</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mafia3-poster.jpg"                      alt="mafia3-poster"                ></p><p>There are few stories as well-told as that in Mafia III. It was brilliant to tackle the story in a documentary format; the brilliant performances of the cast added even more depth to the story. Unfortunately, Mafia III is immensely boring and by-the-numbers in its gameplay. As a result of the busy work required to unlock the best parts of the game, it can be a chore.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• You can tear down the Italian Mafia your way, whether by brute force or guns blazing.</p><p>• Every neighborhood has its unique flavor, from the business district to the bayou.</p><p>• Create a new criminal family of your own.</p><h3 id="4-RESIDENT-EVIL-4"><a href="#4-RESIDENT-EVIL-4" class="headerlink" title="4.RESIDENT EVIL 4"></a>4.RESIDENT EVIL 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-4-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-4-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 4 is a full-fledged action-adventure game that abandons Resident Evil’s survival horror roots. Yet, rather than complaining, fans were thrilled with one of Capcom’s finest games. And it’s had an enormous and long-lasting effect too. Why are there so many third-person games with over-the-shoulder cameras? This can be attributed to RE4, which was so brilliant.</p><p>There is a lot of boulder-punching fun to be had in Resident EThis weird antagonist is transformed into a giant robot thanks to its panicking shootouts, action scenes, and puzzles. Several giant sharks in a lake! A massive Troll-like creature! The weird antagonist as a giant robot! Capcom never stops throwing exciting set-pieces at you, even though it lasts much longer than most single-player games do.</p><p>A strange villager assaults your house, followed by the sound of a chainsaw cutting through your defenses, just like in Night of the Living Dead. The sections where you have to defend Ashley are indeed annoying, but Resident Evil 4 remains the pinnacle of the series. It’s a must-play regardless of when you play it.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• A great action-adventure game.</p><p>• Great graphics and cinematics.</p><p>• The survival factor of the game makes it the greatest of all times.</p><p>• Different difficulty modes of the game make it a perfect choice for everyone.</p><h3 id="5-God-of-War"><a href="#5-God-of-War" class="headerlink" title="5.God of War"></a>5.God of War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-poster"                ></p><p>Kratos and his son Atreus pursue the last wish granted by his dead wife to Fulfill their former God of War’s wife in the epic God of War. The game features a big emphasis on Norse mythology. It lets you explore ancient Norway in the realm of Midgard, where you’ll face danger from mythological beasts and Norse gods themselves who try to prevent you from demolishing the forbidden lands. Fast-paced combat in the title rewards combos and landing hits, but also character development needs to be considered.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Featuring a world based on Norse mythology.</p><p>• A combat system that is fluid and dynamic in third-person.</p><p>• With large maps and hidden collectibles, you’ll want to explore them thoroughly.</p><p>• Stunning visuals that make the game so much more enjoyable.</p><h3 id="6-Red-Dead-Redemption-2"><a href="#6-Red-Dead-Redemption-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Red Dead Redemption 2"></a>6.Red Dead Redemption 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dead-redemption2-poster.png"                      alt="red-dead-redemption2-poster"                ></p><p>Despite similarities to Grand Theft Auto V, saying that RDR 2 is just GTA restyled with an entirely different plot and a group of characters would be misleading at best. It’s accomplished to the point that you can watch people do their chores realistically and observe how they lead their busy lives from dusk till dawn in a very realistic manner, thanks to the large open-world of the game. The satisfying gunplay and the complex interactions with the world are among the gameplay highlights, which react to your actions.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• A touching story with some memorable moments.</p><p>• With a high level of detail, these visuals are exceptional.</p><p>• It is a vast open-world with its own self-contained world.</p><p>• We are able to use a large variety of weapons, from simple knives to tomahawks to shotguns and revolvers.</p><h3 id="7-The-Witcher-3-Wild-Hunt"><a href="#7-The-Witcher-3-Wild-Hunt" class="headerlink" title="7.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"></a>7.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-witcher3-wild-hunt-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-witcher3-wild-hunt-poster"                ></p><p>Seeing how many people regard it as one of the best action-adventure games ever made, it’s easy to see why it was included on the list of the best games ever made. In The Witcher, a mutant hired to undo hexes and hunt down folklore beasts is forced to undertake a life of crime. The story is based on a series of Polish novels.</p><p>While Geralt’s journey concludes with this third and final installment, the biggest battle that will determine the planet’s future lies ahead, and your choice will determine how it will end. Despite being a classic action RPG, the game is so polished that nothing can make it better than what it already is. In a vast living open world, players will find dozens of mysterious places, fight mythical beasts, find powerful loot, and fight the most dangerous creatures that threaten humanity’s very existence. In the evening, after battling hostile creatures all day, you can take a break, visit a local tavern, and play a relaxing game of Gwent with the locals.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It is set in a beautiful fantasy world, where players can make their own choices.</p><p>• Melee attacks, magic spells, and decoctions are used in this form of combat.</p><p>• The players are able to explore a believable open world freely.</p><p>• The character progression system will have skill trees, equipment management, and an experience system.</p><h3 id="8-Metal-Gear-Solid-V-The-Phantom-Pain"><a href="#8-Metal-Gear-Solid-V-The-Phantom-Pain" class="headerlink" title="8.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain"></a>8.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-poster.jpg"                      alt="metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-poster"                ></p><p>The snake returns to the surface, but his body is weak and he has suffered a lot. Having awoken from his nine-year coma after the events of Ground Zero, the Big Boss has yet another dangerous mission ahead of him.</p><p>As you explore Afghanistan and Central Africa during the year 1975, you will be challenged with some of the most difficult tasks. Infiltrating the enemy’s ranks requires a degree of stealth and the game stresses this by giving the protagonist the skills to sneak, hide bodies, make silent takedowns, and equip him with some tranquilizer darts and decoys. It is entirely possible, but discouraged, to go full Rambo.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• There is a lot of action in this dynamic third-person game.</p><p>• Visually stunning landmarks in a vast open-world.</p><p>• Taking a more cautious approach and focusing on stealth play.</p><p>• The best voice actors in the world.</p><h3 id="9-Shadow-of-the-Colossus"><a href="#9-Shadow-of-the-Colossus" class="headerlink" title="9.Shadow of the Colossus"></a>9.Shadow of the Colossus</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadow-of-the-colossus-poster.png"                      alt="shadow-of-the-colossus-poster"                ></p><p>As you might have guessed, Shadow of the Colossus involves exploring an open landscape searching for giant and powerful colossi.</p><p>The gameplay follows the journey of a man trying to restore life to a young girl called Mono in this remake of a 2005 production. To fulfill his wish, he must find and defeat several powerful colossi roaming the land to find and defeat the mysterious entity. It’s asymmetrical gameplay in that you explore the area and fight with the colossi - each one is more powerful than the last, and there isn’t one definitive way to overcome them. Often, harder bosses will require the use of the environment against them to figure out their weak spots.</p><p><strong>Key features</strong></p><p>• An environment with a vast amount of open space.</p><p>• Boss fights are the only focus of the gameplay.</p><p>• Combat system based on skills.</p><p>• It’s like a mini-game to scale colossi with a stamina gauge.</p><h3 id="10-Borderlands-2"><a href="#10-Borderlands-2" class="headerlink" title="10.Borderlands 2"></a>10.Borderlands 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/borderlands-2-poster.png"                      alt="borderlands-2-poster"                ></p><p>Return to the Borderlands universe in style. Start a new epic adventure where every skill you have is as important as your character’s. Earn experience by exploring the world to make your avatar stronger and more effective at using guns or magic-like abilities. Take advantage of rare loot and powerful weapons to deal havoc with anyone who crosses your path. The game is unique in many ways, including its visual style - its comic-like art style is the series’ most recognizable trait. Still, its humorous dialogues and puns also deserve recognition.</p><p><strong>Key features</strong></p><p>• In this action-packed story, the events of Borderlands 1 have been built upon.</p><p>• A skill tree for each of the four character classes.</p><p>• Players will find increasingly powerful weapons and equipment throughout the game through a random loot system.</p><p>• A great dose of humor and many memorable characters.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>So this is the list of the 10 best action-adventure games that you must play. You might feel that some games are missing in this list, but there was a slot of 10 games only as discussed earlier. If you’re looking to kill some time while doing quality gaming, you’ll enjoy all the games listed above.</p><p>Even though it was released in 2013, it is still the most popular game of all time in 2021.

You might feel that some games are missing in this list, but there was a slot of 10 games only as discussed earlier. If you’re looking to kill some time while doing quality gaming, you’ll enjoy all the games listed above.</p><p>Even though it was released in 2013, it is still the most popular game of all time in 2021. Players have always enjoyed a great deal of freedom in GTA games, but GTA V took things to the next level. Whether you want to drive a car, shoot some baddies, fly a helicopter, go to the movies, play golf, or just relax, the possibilities are almost endless.</p><p>The story of Grand Theft Auto V revolves around a group of three characters involved in a plot, which includes major characters such as the Federal Investigation Bureau, the International Affairs Agency, and the Merryweather private army. If you manage to complete the story mode, learn all skills, upgrade and master all weapons, and finish all side missions, the fun never really ends because the online mode is updated constantly and occasionally has events.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• There’s never a dull moment with this engaging and addictive story.</p><p>• A realistic and enormous open-world environment.</p><p>• You can customize tons of weapons in this game.</p><p>• Tons of exclusive multiplayer content continually updated online.</p><h3 id="2-Uncharted-4-A-Thief’s-End-3"><a href="#2-Uncharted-4-A-Thief’s-End-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End"></a>2.Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uncharted4-a-thiefs-end-poster.jpg"                      alt="uncharted4-a-thiefs-end-poster"                ></p><p>The Uncharted 4 game is an action-packed adventure filled with elements that make a great action title.</p><p>As the Drake brothers hunt for the long-lost pirate treasure, the game tells the story of the brothers and their adventures. As they travel, they will contact dangerous people who will need their help, and they will encounter puzzles that require their sharpest minds to complete. You will be able to explore beautiful locations and enjoy detailed graphics and an excellent narrative to go with the game. It may be disappointing for some that this game is exclusive to PlayStation 4, but if you haven’t played it yet, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to consider picking up the console just for this one title - it’s one of the most popular PS4 games right now.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Adventures involving seasoned treasure hunters provide an addictive storyline.</p><p>• A variety of activities are included, such as climbing, shooting, exploring, and sneaking.</p><p>• Smooth animations and stunning graphics make the game feel very realistic.</p><p>• It features a multiplayer mode for up to ten players and several modes of play.</p><h3 id="3-Mafia-III-3"><a href="#3-Mafia-III-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Mafia III"></a>3.Mafia III</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mafia3-poster.jpg"                      alt="mafia3-poster"                ></p><p>There are few stories as well-told as that in Mafia III. It was brilliant to tackle the story in a documentary format; the brilliant performances of the cast added even more depth to the story. Unfortunately, Mafia III is immensely boring and by-the-numbers in its gameplay. As a result of the busy work required to unlock the best parts of the game, it can be a chore.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• You can tear down the Italian Mafia your way, whether by brute force or guns blazing.</p><p>• Every neighborhood has its unique flavor, from the business district to the bayou.</p><p>• Create a new criminal family of your own.</p><h3 id="4-RESIDENT-EVIL-4-3"><a href="#4-RESIDENT-EVIL-4-3" class="headerlink" title="4.RESIDENT EVIL 4"></a>4.RESIDENT EVIL 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-4-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-4-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 4 is a full-fledged action-adventure game that abandons Resident Evil’s survival horror roots. Yet, rather than complaining, fans were thrilled with one of Capcom’s finest games. And it’s had an enormous and long-lasting effect too. Why are there so many third-person games with over-the-shoulder cameras? This can be attributed to RE4, which was so brilliant.</p><p>There is a lot of boulder-punching fun to be had in Resident EThis weird antagonist is transformed into a giant robot thanks to its panicking shootouts, action scenes, and puzzles. Several giant sharks in a lake! A massive Troll-like creature! The weird antagonist as a giant robot! Capcom never stops throwing exciting set-pieces at you, even though it lasts much longer than most single-player games do.</p><p>A strange villager assaults your house, followed by the sound of a chainsaw cutting through your defenses, just like in Night of the Living Dead. The sections where you have to defend Ashley are indeed annoying, but Resident Evil 4 remains the pinnacle of the series. It’s a must-play regardless of when you play it.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• A great action-adventure game.</p><p>• Great graphics and cinematics.</p><p>• The survival factor of the game makes it the greatest of all times.</p><p>• Different difficulty modes of the game make it a perfect choice for everyone.</p><h3 id="5-God-of-War-3"><a href="#5-God-of-War-3" class="headerlink" title="5.God of War"></a>5.God of War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-poster"                ></p><p>Kratos and his son Atreus pursue the last wish granted by his dead wife to Fulfill their former God of War’s wife in the epic God of War. The game features a big emphasis on Norse mythology. It lets you explore ancient Norway in the realm of Midgard, where you’ll face danger from mythological beasts and Norse gods themselves who try to prevent you from demolishing the forbidden lands. Fast-paced combat in the title rewards combos and landing hits, but also character development needs to be considered.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Featuring a world based on Norse mythology.</p><p>• A combat system that is fluid and dynamic in third-person.</p><p>• With large maps and hidden collectibles, you’ll want to explore them thoroughly.</p><p>• Stunning visuals that make the game so much more enjoyable.</p><h3 id="6-Red-Dead-Redemption-2-3"><a href="#6-Red-Dead-Redemption-2-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Red Dead Redemption 2"></a>6.Red Dead Redemption 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dead-redemption2-poster.png"                      alt="red-dead-redemption2-poster"                ></p><p>Despite similarities to Grand Theft Auto V, saying that RDR 2 is just GTA restyled with an entirely different plot and a group of characters would be misleading at best. It’s accomplished to the point that you can watch people do their chores realistically and observe how they lead their busy lives from dusk till dawn in a very realistic manner, thanks to the large open-world of the game. The satisfying gunplay and the complex interactions with the world are among the gameplay highlights, which react to your actions.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• A touching story with some memorable moments.</p><p>• With a high level of detail, these visuals are exceptional.</p><p>• It is a vast open-world with its own self-contained world.</p><p>• We are able to use a large variety of weapons, from simple knives to tomahawks to shotguns and revolvers.</p><h3 id="7-The-Witcher-3-Wild-Hunt-3"><a href="#7-The-Witcher-3-Wild-Hunt-3" class="headerlink" title="7.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"></a>7.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-witcher3-wild-hunt-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-witcher3-wild-hunt-poster"                ></p><p>Seeing how many people regard it as one of the best action-adventure games ever made, it’s easy to see why it was included on the list of the best games ever made. In The Witcher, a mutant hired to undo hexes and hunt down folklore beasts is forced to undertake a life of crime. The story is based on a series of Polish novels.</p><p>While Geralt’s journey concludes with this third and final installment, the biggest battle that will determine the planet’s future lies ahead, and your choice will determine how it will end. Despite being a classic action RPG, the game is so polished that nothing can make it better than what it already is. In a vast living open world, players will find dozens of mysterious places, fight mythical beasts, find powerful loot, and fight the most dangerous creatures that threaten humanity’s very existence. In the evening, after battling hostile creatures all day, you can take a break, visit a local tavern, and play a relaxing game of Gwent with the locals.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It is set in a beautiful fantasy world, where players can make their own choices.</p><p>• Melee attacks, magic spells, and decoctions are used in this form of combat.</p><p>• The players are able to explore a believable open world freely.</p><p>• The character progression system will have skill trees, equipment management, and an experience system.</p><h3 id="8-Metal-Gear-Solid-V-The-Phantom-Pain-3"><a href="#8-Metal-Gear-Solid-V-The-Phantom-Pain-3" class="headerlink" title="8.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain"></a>8.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-poster.jpg"                      alt="metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-poster"                ></p><p>The snake returns to the surface, but his body is weak and he has suffered a lot.

This information will make your task easier:</p><h4 id="1-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-Game-Bar-on-Windows-10"><a href="#1-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-Game-Bar-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="1. Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10"></a>1. Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10</h4><p>If you are not interested in installing any additional tool on your gaming PC, it is even possible to capture high-quality game screenshots using Game Bar. While playing an adventure game, you first need to open the game bar; but it is easy to do with keyboard-based shortcuts. Simply press, Windows + Alt + Print Screen or it can also be done by hitting Windows + G keys. As soon as the Game Bar is open on your screen, hit the camera shaped button available on the bar; it is named “Screenshot.”</p><p>In case if you find it little difficult to open your game bar using these keys in between a game; Windows 10 also allows users to customize these keys as per their convenience. You can alter the shortcut keys by switching to Settings, then Gaming and finally Game Bar. As soon as you capture a screenshot using Game Bar, the system shows an instant notification “Screenshot saved,” it appears on the bottom right corner of the screen. All these screenshots are automatically saved at Captures&#x2F; Videos section along with all other videos that you have captured till now using Windows 10 Game Bar feature.</p><h4 id="2-Taking-Screenshots-Using-In-Game-Shortcuts"><a href="#2-Taking-Screenshots-Using-In-Game-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="2. Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts"></a>2. Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts</h4><p>In case if you are not playing games on Steam, it is still possible to capture screenshots with many built-in shortcuts and screenshot functions. In most of the games, the screenshot can be captured instantly using “Print Screen” key; however, few games may follow other settings for screen capture. As soon as you tap the key in question, the game will instantly save a screenshot at a specific location on the disk. For example, in all Blizzard’s Battle.net games, the Print Screen key always helps to capture a screenshot, and they can be later found in a hard drive-based folder. However, the folder name can be different for every game; for example, if you capture a screenshot while playing Overwatch, it will be saved at folder location: Documents\Overwatch\Screenshots\Overwatch. You can perform a web search to know the suitable screenshot key for every game. This information can also be obtained from the shortcut configuration menu.</p><h4 id="3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut"><a href="#3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="3. Taking Screenshots Using Steam’s Shortcut"></a>3. Taking Screenshots Using Steam’s Shortcut</h4><p>In case if you are playing your favorite game on Steam, it is possible to capture screenshots instantly by using the built-in screen capture feature of Steam. The great news is that capturing a screenshot with Steam is quite easier; you simply need to hit “F12” key on your keyboard. As soon as you press the key, a shutter sound will be heard on the system and a notification saying “Screenshot Saved” will appear instantly on the bottom right corner of PC screen.</p><p>In case if you do not find F12 key easier to access during your games, you can also customize this key by going to Steam Interface section. Go to settings and then In-Game and finally adjust the “Screenshot Shortcut Keys” option as per your requirement. If you want to view the captured screenshots, open them using Shift + Tab key on Steam Overlay; or if you have altered the settings on Steam, it can be done using your custom shortcut on the keyboard. Finally, click “View Screenshots” button on the overlay.</p><p>If you want to see your screenshots after exiting the game, you will find them on Steam library by opening game page. Simply scroll down towards bottom area of your game’s page, and the screenshots will be available with a “View Screenshot Library” option. You will be happy to know that it is possible to upload captured screenshots directly to Facebook using screenshot library. You can also find your captured screenshots using “Show on Disk” button.</p><h4 id="4-Capturing-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-GeForce-Experience"><a href="#4-Capturing-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-GeForce-Experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Capturing Screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience"></a>4. Capturing Screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience</h4><p>In case if you are working with Nvidia graphics, the chances are that your system also has Nvidia’s GeForce Experience software. This software tool is loaded with wide range of features and the screenshot capturing ability is one of them. In order to capture a game screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience, simply hit Alt + F1 key and the screenshot will get automatically saved into GeForce Experience Gallery. As soon as the screenshot is captured, the system also displays an instant notification about it saying “Screenshot has been saved to Gallery” on the top right side of your screen.</p><p>In order to view the captured screenshots, you can press Alt + Z button on your Windows system. Go to Gallery to view all your game screenshots; note that they will be saved along with the ShadowPlay Videos on your system. These screenshots can also be found under Videos\Name of the Game path along with videos that you have captured using GeForce Experience.</p><h4 id="5-Taking-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-Ansel"><a href="#5-Taking-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-Ansel" class="headerlink" title="5. Taking Screenshot with Nvidia Ansel"></a>5. Taking Screenshot with Nvidia Ansel</h4><p>There is no doubt to say that GeForce Experience provides a rich experience with its awesome features but here is another tool from Nvidia that can also help you to capture screenshots; however, it allows users to capture them using moving camera. Note that, this option works only with few specific games, only if the developer has added support for this feature. However, there are many popular games in the list that support Nvidia Ansel feature like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, Dishonored 2, etc.</p><p>When you are playing the game, simply hit Alt + F2 key and the gameplay will instantly freeze; along with this, “Ansel” sidebar will appear on the screen. Now you can adjust the screen for capturing region specific screenshot using drag and drop feature of a mouse or with the help of keyboard keys. In case if you are interested in adding a unique filter effect to your screenshot, it can be done by using various options available on the sidebar; gamers love to use sepia tone or wish to adjust the field of view for their captured shots. You can also make selections for whether you want to capture your game screenshots with a normal view or need super-resolution. Some of you may also be interested in capturing a 360-degree screenshot with Nvidia Ansel. These 360-degree screenshots can be later viewed via different methods like HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or using Google Cardboard Headset.</p><p>Hit the snap button, and your screenshots will be saved instantly; this system allows you to capture an unlimited number of shots with the paused screen. You can later view these screenshots by pressing Alt + Z key on your system or by simply clicking “Gallery” option. These screenshots are generally saved at Videos\Name of the Game path.</p><h4 id="6-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-AMD-ReLive-Feature"><a href="#6-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-AMD-ReLive-Feature" class="headerlink" title="6. Taking Game Screenshots with AMD ReLive Feature"></a>6. Taking Game Screenshots with AMD ReLive Feature</h4><p>In case if you are working on AMD graphics hardware, you can capture screenshots with the help of its ReLive Feature. Note that, this feature works only if you are using a desktop with AMD Graphics Core Next Architecture. However, it is not so fancy like Nvidia Ansel; the screen capture option is almost same as Steam or the Nvidia GeForce Experience. As soon as you are ready with ReLive, simply hit Ctrl + Shift + E button or use Alt + Z. Now click on the “Screenshot” option to capture the screenshot from your favorite game. It will be saved by default into videos folder on your system. You can share these screenshots later with your friends online to showcase your gaming adventure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Being a dedicated and crazy gamer, you may always be interested in sharing your gaming experiences with your friends online.

Learn all the essential elements and steps to record voice over like professionals.</p><p>For every video you come across, the audio part is equally important as the visual part. Even when the visual part is top-notch, if the audio part such as background music and the voice narration is not good enough, you lose interest in the video. Therefore, you have to pay equal attention to the video recording as well as voiceover recording. A voiceover is basically a person speaking in the background as the video is playing along to make proper sense as well as to add more context to the video.</p><p>A voiceover recording can be describing the video, explaining concepts, highlighting important points, and likewise. Generally, a voiceover is added to the video after the video is already recorded. In order to record a good voice over, there are certain essential elements you need to have beforehand. In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos. Imagine watching a tutorial video where there is no voice to explain what is happening on the screen, everyone will leave the video immediately. Therefore, a voiceover essentially explains the video so that everyone can understand and even relate properly.</p><h2 id="2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over"><a href="#2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over" class="headerlink" title="2. Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin.

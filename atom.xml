The controller has an excellent battery life, very accurate analog sticks, and large buttons more substantial than those on the Switch joy cons. Especially if you’ve been using an Xbox 360 controller for a while and are ready to upgrade, it’s an excellent choice for your next PC controller.</p><p>Utilizing the Nintendo Switch Pro controller for most of your PC games is a breeze thanks to Steam’s controller configurator, which officially supports this controller. Plug-and-play is the most accurate description. To play games, not on Steam, you need to use this guide.</p><p>This article will tell you how to enable your Nintendo Switch Pro controller to work with Steam or Windows, either through a Bluetooth connection or a wired connection. The first thing you’ll need is a Nintendo Switch Pro controller (obviously) and a USB-C cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-poster.jpg"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Best Nintendo Switch Emulators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record Nintendo Switch Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Wired-Connection-for-Switch-Pro-Controllers"><a href="#Wired-Connection-for-Switch-Pro-Controllers" class="headerlink" title="Wired Connection for Switch Pro Controllers"></a><strong>Wired Connection for Switch Pro Controllers</strong></h2><p>Windows describe it as a DirectInput controller instead of an XInput controller, so getting it to work with PC games can prove tedious. However, thanks to Value-adding full Switch controller support to Steam, you will probably be able to play most of your favorite games.</p><p><strong>Step1:</strong> Connect the Pro Controller cable (or any USB-A-to-USB-C cable) to your PC. If your computer has a USB-C port, connect the USB-C-to-USB-C data cable instead.</p><p><strong>Step2:</strong> Connect the other end of the cable to your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-connected-with-cable.jpg"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-connected-with-cable"                ></p><p>There you have it!

It is possible to switch between using the Nintendo Button Layout (clockwise X, A, B, Y from the top) or the Xbox controller button layout (clockwise Y, B, A, X).</p><p>When configured through Steam, you should use the Pro Controller with any Steam game similar to an Xbox gamepad. Vibration can be enabled or disabled by selecting a controller from the “Detected Controllers” list in the same setup screen as before. It is possible to calibrate the analog sticks by clicking the Calibrate button manually. Also, the controller can be set to disconnect after a specified amount of time before going to sleep.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-steam-set-up2.png"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-steam-set-up2"                ></p><p>Enter the Switch Pro Controller overlay from Steam’s controller options while running in Big Picture mode. There are several ways to map the inputs on the Pro Controller, but default configurations are usually sufficient for most games. By changing the controller mapping based on the situation, you can fix any problems on the fly.</p><h2 id="What-To-Do-With-Non-Steam-Games"><a href="#What-To-Do-With-Non-Steam-Games" class="headerlink" title="What To Do With Non-Steam Games?"></a><strong>What To Do With Non-Steam Games?</strong></h2><p>Using the methods discussed above, you can easily use a switch pro controller with your pc, but it only works with steam games.

It works well with all major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. It sets no limit on the duration of your films, which makes it great for hours-long recordings and video broadcasts. It can interact with video conferencing apps like Zoom smoothly, enabling you to enhance its usefulness and capabilities. All these capabilities of OBS Studio unarguably make it a helpful tool for video conferencing.</p><p>Open Broadcaster Software Studio is mostly used by video broadcasters to live stream videos and events. However, it may also be a terrific video conferencing tool that lets you manage what’s on the screen. Today, many companies’ professionals utilize Zoom for organizing video meetings and exploring methods to improve their visual experience. If you are a Zoom user and seeking a means to make your video calls pixel-perfect, there is good news for you. The adaptability of OBS Studio answers your demands and enables you to link Zoom with OBS Studio.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">Use Roblox Built-In Game Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a>Filmora Screen Recorder</h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom</h2><p>Zoom is one of the most popular video conferencing programs. The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu. Find and click on the plugin you have downloaded and follow the vizard to replicate OBS output as a virtual camera.</p><p>**<strong>Configure Zoom:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> In Zoom, begin a meeting, then pick a video source. The new option introduced by your OBS plugin will display. Select it and then click on the Start Video option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-zoom.jpg"                      alt="configure zoom"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> The Zoom’s video will now accept the input from the virtual camera, which is the output provided by OBS Studio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/accept-the-input.jpg"                      alt="accept the input"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Most of you will be on a mobile device and mobile device displays are of a different aspect ratio than your PC. Click on the Profile menu on OBS at the top and click on New Profile and name the Profile as per your convenience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast. It is important to have a backdrop layout ready before adding to your stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-the-add.jpg"                      alt="click on the add"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> OBS will catch the complete Zoom window; just trim out to capture only your guests’ face cam. You may select “Start Streaming” if you need to webcast the conference elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-streaming.jpg"                      alt="start streaming"                ></p><p>If you wish to put yourself into the Stream from your PC associated webcam or other video devices linked, utilize the Video Source Option instead of Window Capture and specify your target device when adding the source. Just make sure you have unmuted the Desktop Audio and Mic&#x2F;Aux or any mic connected to your PC from the Audio Mixed option at the bottom center of OBS.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS"></a>Part 3. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu.

So, the technology is continuously evolving to give the participants the best video-conferencing experience. Grid view is one of the features that video-conferencing applications provide to their users to see all participants.</p><p>Previously, only 4 participants could be viewed in the Grid view mode. However, Google Meet has introduced a tiled layout in an update that lets you see 49 participants simultaneously on the screen. The following article will educate you about enabling grid and tiled view in Google Meet and address some other relevant concerns.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Enable-Tiled-View-in-Google-Meet-to-See-Everyone-on-Desktop"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Enable-Tiled-View-in-Google-Meet-to-See-Everyone-on-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Enable Tiled View in Google Meet to See Everyone on Desktop?"></a>Part 1: How to Enable Tiled View in Google Meet to See Everyone on Desktop?</h2><p>The tiled view is one of the preferred layout options in Google Meet. Tiled view in Google Meet expanded the range of visible participants. So, if you have joined a video conference room of many participants, Google Meet tiled layout can help you view all participants simultaneously.</p><p>Moreover, when the speaker switches among participants, the screen does not change when the tiled mode is enabled. Do you want to learn how to enable tiled view in Google Meet on desktop? If yes, follow the simple steps below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Google Meet and join the meeting</strong></p><p>Access the Google Meet website or launch its app. Click on the new meeting to start a video session.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also join the meeting using an invitation link or entering code. This works when you are joining the session as a participant, not a host.</p><p>Step 2: Switch to tiled layout</p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the bottom of the screen. Select <strong>change layout</strong> from the menu and choose the <strong>tiled</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-change-layout.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet change layout"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Expand View</strong></p><p>Use a slider to increase or decrease the number of participants you want to see.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The slider can expand the view up to 49 participants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-tiled-view-to-view-participants.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet change enable tiled view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Enable-Grid-View-on-Google-Meet-Mobile-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Enable-Grid-View-on-Google-Meet-Mobile-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Enable Grid View on Google Meet Mobile Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to Enable Grid View on Google Meet Mobile Apps?</h2><p>Google Meet apps don’t support the change layout option. Thus, there are two approaches to enable the Grid view when participating in a Google Meet session through mobile phone. The following section will explain both methods in a simple step-by-step process. Let’s have a look at both of them.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Join-Meeting-through-phone’s-browser"><a href="#Method-1-Join-Meeting-through-phone’s-browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Join Meeting through phone’s browser"></a>Method 1: Join Meeting through phone’s browser</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Enable desktop site</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> and enable the <strong>desktop site</strong> option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-desktop-site-google-meet-browser-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet mobile view all participants"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Change layout Enable tiled view to view up to 49 people at the same time</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the bottom right corner and select <strong>change layout.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-google-meet-layout-tiled-view.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet change tiled view"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-someone-else-to-share-the-screen"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-someone-else-to-share-the-screen" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Ask someone else to share the screen"></a>Method 2: Ask someone else to share the screen</h3><p>Ask any other participant in the meeting to share the screen with tiled mode enabled.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure the participant you request to share the screen uses Google Meet on desktop with a tiled layout. Plus, if the participant sharing screen is on mobile, request the participant join the meeting from a mobile browser rather than the app.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Grid-View-Extension-to-View-All-Participants-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Grid-View-Extension-to-View-All-Participants-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Grid View Extension to View All Participants on Google Meet?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Grid View Extension to View All Participants on Google Meet?</h2><p>Grid view extension is another method of monitoring all participants of the meeting in Google Meet. So, if you cannot enable tiled layout in Google Meet, this extension can be helpful. If you are in a quest to know more about the Grid View extension, its installation, and how to use it in Google Meet, we have summarized the process in easy and simple steps below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add Grid View extension to the chrome</strong></p><p>Launch Chrome browser and access <strong>chrome.google.com</strong>.

Google Meet Grid View extension has proved to be a blessing for meeting hosts and participants of the Google Meet session. However, many Google Meet users have reported issues with the working of Google Meet Grid View recently. We have a quick fix for you if you encounter issues while using or enabling the Grid View. Let’s follow the step-by-step guide below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the latest version of Grid View.</strong></p><p>Install 1.31 or newer version of Grid view by clicking on the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-grid-view/kklailfgofogmmdlhgmjgenehkjoioip?hl=en" >extension link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tap <strong>add to chrome</strong> option. Then, select add an extension when a pop-up message appears.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Chrome tools and Enable developer mode</strong></p><p>Open Google Chrome and click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the top right corner. Choose <strong>more tools</strong> from the list. Select Extensions from the list of options in the more tools and turn on the developer mode at the top right of the corner.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Also, check whether the extension is installed or not. If it is available, try re-installing it. If it is still not visible, update Google chrome.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-grid-view-extension-developer-mode.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet view all extension enable"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 : Check the working in Google Meet</strong></p><p>Click <strong>new meeting</strong> in the Google Meet. <strong>Tap enable grid view</strong> when you want to see all participants in the meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-google-meet-grid-view-troubleshooting.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet view all extension enable"                ></p><h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-See-Everyone-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-See-Everyone-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions About See Everyone on Google Meet"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About See Everyone on Google Meet</h3><h4 id="1-How-do-I-see-everyone-on-Google-Meet-mobile"><a href="#1-How-do-I-see-everyone-on-Google-Meet-mobile" class="headerlink" title="1. How do I see everyone on Google Meet mobile?"></a>1. How do I see everyone on Google Meet mobile?</h4><p>Google Meet does not allow to view more than 4 participants simultaneously on iOS and Android Devices. However, if it is crucial for you to monitor the activity of all participants, it is better to use the browser on the phone rather than the application. It is better to enable desktop mode before joining the Google Meeting session on the phone’s browser. And the most people that you can see in the screen is 49 at the time of writing.</p><h4 id="2-Why-can’t-I-install-the-Grid-View-extension"><a href="#2-Why-can’t-I-install-the-Grid-View-extension" class="headerlink" title="2. Why can’t I install the Grid View extension?"></a>2. Why can’t I install the Grid View extension?</h4><p>You might not be able to download the Grid View extension for a couple of reasons. Most of the time, you have a duplicate extension installed. So, you need to delete all duplicate extensions and then re-install the Grid View extension. Another reason for encountering issues when installing an extension can be that you are not downloading it from the right developer.</p><h4 id="3-Can-you-record-a-Google-Meet-in-grid-view"><a href="#3-Can-you-record-a-Google-Meet-in-grid-view" class="headerlink" title="3. Can you record a Google Meet in grid view?"></a>3. Can you record a Google Meet in grid view?</h4><p>If you think about whether one can record a Google Meet session in Grid view, the answer is yes for the one hosting a meeting. So, the person sharing a screen and talking will be recorded, and Google Meet in-built recorder will not record all participants in the tile.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sometimes, it becomes essential to make all participants visible in the grid. For instance, if you have been asked to invigilate students in an online test, monitoring the activity of all participants becomes your job duty. Like other conferencing apps, Google Meet offers a grid view to see participants in your window. Alongside auto, slide bar, and spotlight, Google Meet facilitates the users with the tiled view. In this article, we have gathered sufficient information on how to enable grid view in Google Meet. Not just on desktop, the article mentions configuring the layout on mobile devices as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-revolutionary-6-sustainable-minecraft-homes/"><u>[New] In 2024, Revolutionary 6 Sustainable Minecraft Homes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-the-power-of-your-everyday-webcam/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unlocking the Power of Your Everyday Webcam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-10-royale-showdowns/"><u>[New] Ultimate 10 Royale Showdowns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-audio-archiving-strategies-on-apple-devices/"><u>2024 Approved  Audio Archiving Strategies on Apple Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-screen-savvy-secure-your-captures-chromebooks-top-4-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Screen Savvy  Secure Your Captures - Chromebook's Top 4 Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-conquering-broadcasts-merge-obs-zoom-with-ease/"><u>[New] Conquering Broadcasts  Merge OBS, Zoom with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-organizing-your-skype-conversations-windowsmac-edition-for-2024/"><u>[New] Organizing Your Skype Conversations  Windows/Mac Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/mastering-mp3s-on-android-the-best-free-tools/"><u>Mastering MP3s on Android - The Best Free Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/revealing-the-best-of-both-worlds-1-tiktoks-on-twitter/"><u>Revealing the Best of Both Worlds  #1 TikToks on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-snapshot-showdown-youtube-shorts-challenge-to-the-titans-of-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] Snapshot Showdown  YouTube Shorts Challenge to the Titans of TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/smooth-transition-of-short-videos-to-youtube-device-guide-for-2024/"><u>Smooth Transition of Short Videos to YouTube - Device Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-whipped-watchers-guide-complete-review-of-frozen-food-filming-tech/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Whipped Watcher's Guide  Complete Review of Frozen Food Filming Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/techniques-for-perfect-chroma-key-compositing-for-2024/"><u>Techniques for Perfect Chroma Key Compositing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-tecno-pova-6-pro-5g-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices Using Bluetooth? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crop-trim-and-perfect-mastering-video-editing-with-avidemux/"><u>2024 Approved Crop, Trim, and Perfect Mastering Video Editing with Avidemux</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/iconic-identity-cues-brilliant-animation/"><u>Iconic Identity Cues  Brilliant Animation</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Before sharing, please check your window once to makes sure that you don’t have anything that you wish to be shared with the other person.</p><p>Note:</p><p>Once sharing the screen is started all your activities on the screen will be shown to the other person.</p><ul><li>1.

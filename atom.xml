Users may meet face to face, communicate with associates via in-meeting chatting or conference call, &amp; share their presentations via screen sharing.</p><p>Meetings may be accessed via a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. All GoToMeeting sessions (also known as webinars) can be recorded. This article explains how to record a <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> session in detail, including a step-by-step approach.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record GoToMeeting with an Online Recorder</a></p><p>Part 4. <a href="#part4">Record GoToMeeting on iPhone and Android</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder"></a>Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</h2><p>Meetings can be recorded using the built-in <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> option, but there are limits.</p><p>However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1. Just click over the “REC” icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg"                      alt="gotomeeting start record"                ></p><p>Step 2. While recording, click “Start Your Recording,” and the “REC” icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.</p><p>Step 3. Click over the “REC” icon and choose “Stop Your Recording” to stop the recording. If you’re making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you’re doing a cloud recording, you’ll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.</p><p>Step 4. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions? In this instance, you’ll need a video-recording program that works on both PCs and Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC"></a>Part 2. Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC</h2><p>The built-in recorder for GoToMeeting has several restrictions that make many users look for a third-party application to record meetings. Work is cumbersome due to constraints. As a result, it is preferable to seek a substitute. A good <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to <strong>record gotomeeting webinar</strong> may make your job a lot simpler and more productive.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is a suitable alternative.

You may use the microphone or even the audio on your computer system to record sound or speech. If you choose, you may turn off the audio recording.</p><p>Step 4: Record your GoToMeeting seasons</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-gotomeet-filmora.jpg"                      alt="record gotomeeting filmora"                ></p><p>Please click the REC button once everything is ready, and the application will count down 3,2,1 and begin recording.

Key Features of Active Presenter</h2><p>Active Presenter is a popular tutorial and software simulation screen recorder that is known for its key features. It offers many of the same capabilities as a standard screen recorder, allowing users to record any type of video.</p><p>Recording – Recording allows you to capture video from your screen and webcam at the same time or independently, and audio from your system or an external microphone. Voice-overs and audio narration can also be added.</p><p>Editing – Active Presenter’s video and audio editor allows basic editing, such as cutting, copying, pasting and deleting. Complex modifications can also be made to audio and video clips - users can insert clips, speed up or slow down videos, blur items or apply green screen effects to them.</p><p>Software Simulation – Apart from recording regular video, you can record software simulation. In software simulation, you get a series of slides instead of a video. These slides can be regular slides or video slides.

The design is responsive and hence, it can run on any web browser on any device.</p><p>Versatile Export Options – Various export options are available, allowing you to export your video in multiple file formats including MP4, AVI, WMV, and MKV. You can also customize the frame rate, video quality, keyframe parameters, and other settings to decrease the output file size.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-Active-Presenter"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-Active-Presenter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Best Alternative to Active Presenter"></a>Part 4.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined.

Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast.

Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device.

There’s a whole new branch of subtopics that needs to be addressed regarding the morality and legality of purchasing games, but that’s not our focus in this article.</p><p>Yuzu was the first Switch emulator to be released. From the makers of Citra, one of the most popular 3DS emulators comes this free and open-source emulator. The emulator runs on C++ and is designed to emulate the Nintendo Switch’s essential hardware components. function. Some games have problems with this, which is one of the reasons the performance in certain titles is less than ideal.</p><p>Despite the lack of power, Yuzu managed to run Super Mario Odyssey at a frame rate comparable to the Switchback in 2019. There was no sign of lag or missing parts of the background scenery, which is impressive for an emulator. Right from the start, users feel confident about Yuzu. It’s clearly designed and provides users with everything they need to know.

Some games run better on Yuzu and others that work better on Ryujinx. Ryujinx is probably one of the best Nintendo Switch emulators. There is a full range of robust features available in this software. Additionally, it provides an intuitive interface that anyone can operate. It is unique because it has been developed in C#, unlike other programs and is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p><p>It contains 1000 games, of which half are considered playable. Ryujinx highlights this information to potential users from the start. They may still have some way to go until it’s perfect, but they’re at least honest and aware of the obstacles. To deliver a better-than-expected experience, Gdkchan, the team behind the software, is continuously improving the accuracy and performance as well as the user interface and build consistency.</p><p>This speedy emulator has very little room for failure, which makes it one of the safest options. Aside from these advantages, the Ryujinx emulator is easy to use and can run games at 60fps. However, even though this emulator is amazing, it is still unable to run commercial Nintendo Switch games which is the only downfall of this emulator. The developers are continuously working on it to make it better. The experience is quite close to console-like, even right on your desktop.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Display resolutions can be customized, as well as the scaling.</li><li>Various aspect ratios are also available.</li><li>Auto mode automatically enables anisotropic filtering.</li><li>With Discord Rich, you can showcase your Nintendo game on Discord.</li><li>You can also play multiplayer online with your friends.

Overall it is very complicated procedures and new users may find it extremely difficult to use it in the beginning.</p><p>Although getting games on this emulator is a bit difficult, there is still a huge list of games that you are compatible with, and you can play them on excellent graphics without any lag or distortion. Basically, it is a mobile emulator and you need to have a strong chipset in your phone if you want to run this emulator and get excellent results. As mentioned on the official website of egg, it works on Snapdragon 855, 855+ and 865 phones. The website has also issued a list of compatible phones which check on the website link mentioned above.</p><p>Although Egg Ns Emulator can not run many games compared to other emulators and gives comparatively less performance, it is expected that it will improve a lot and give a tough competition to other emulators. Currently, it is in active development and it is continuously improving with the updates.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Huge list of compatible games.</li><li>Works very well on mobile devices.</li><li>Get the most out of your gaming experience</li><li>Controls that are smooth and responsive</li><li>Easily navigable interface</li><li>Sections with clear defined</li><li>Multiple languages supported</li><li>No advertising available</li></ul><hr><h4 id="Is-It-Legal-to-Use-Emulators"><a href="#Is-It-Legal-to-Use-Emulators" class="headerlink" title="Is It Legal to Use Emulators?"></a><strong>Is It Legal to Use Emulators?</strong></h4><p>You can download and use emulators legally, but sharing copyrighted ROMs is illegal. The use of ROMs you own does not have a precedent in law, although one could argue it is fair use. In short, if you are using an emulator then you won’t have any legal issues and technically you aren’t doing anything that is illegal. So, calm your mind and enjoy your favourite games using emulators.</p><hr><h4 id="Where-to-Download-Games"><a href="#Where-to-Download-Games" class="headerlink" title="Where to Download Games?"></a><strong>Where to <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu-games-wiki/tree/master/games" >Download Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></h4><p>It is one of the most frequently asked questions about emulator games. You can download the emulator and install it but how will you get the games? The answer is simple. Each emulator has its own website where you can find the list of compatible games with that emulator and you can also download the games from their websites. Alternatively, you can use third-party websites, torrents, and GitHub to get the games for emulators.</p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>In this article, we shared the three best NS emulators using which you can enjoy your favourite switch games through your mobile and pc.

To get your hand on the application and learn how to use it, you gotta follow the steps below. Before moving to the “How’s” you need to know that the Chrome OS native screenshot generally comes with the OS but if you are an old user and using the old version then you will need to bring it on your OS. Let’s see how can we do that.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Setting-Up"><a href="#Step-1-Setting-Up" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Setting Up"></a>Step 1: Setting Up</h3><p>If you are not seeing the recorder out of the box then you will need to access the Chrome OS features.

And you will see enable option in front of the screen capture bar, enable it and you will be asked for a permission reset prompt and it’s done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chrome-native-screen-recorder-setting-up.jpg"                      alt="chrome native screen recorder setting up"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Recorder-Screen"><a href="#Step-2-Recorder-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Recorder Screen"></a>Step 2: Recorder Screen</h3><p>Once you are done with settings up the flag or you are using the latest Chrome OS now it’s time to move to record your screen. Go to the lower right button of your OS screen and click on the shelf as shown in the figure below. A new window will appear, now you will need to click on the screen capture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chrome-recorder-screen-screen-capture.jpg"                      alt="chrome recorder screen screen capture"                ></p><p>Soon as you click on the screen capture, you will be prompted to a new screen with a variety of options for the tool as shown.

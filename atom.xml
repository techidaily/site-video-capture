Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources.

The TV schedule doesn’t wait for us, regardless of how much we would like to watch the latest episode of a popular TV series or the TV premiere of the latest Marvel movie.</p><p>All of this can be easily avoided with a piece of equipment that enables you to record TV shows on your Windows PC or your laptop. If you were trying to find a way to record live TV shows from a computer, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we will take you through all the steps you need to take in order to start recording TV shows on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Pay-Attention-to-Copyright"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to Copyright"></a>Pay Attention to Copyright</h2><p>Supporting piracy is illegal, we don’t support it and we have no desire to promote it in this article. The artists and the TV industry professionals are working hard to produce informative and entertaining content so it is only natural to respect their copyrights.</p><p>Any form of unauthorized distribution or copying of TV shows or films is strictly prohibited and people who get caught breaking the copyright laws can face criminal charges. However, recording a TV show on a PC and watching it privately is hardly a criminal offense and it can spare you the trouble of dealing with video stream glitches and more importantly, it will allow you to watch the shows, games, or movies when you have enough time.</p><h2 id="What-Will-You-Need-to-Record-a-TV-show-from-your-PC"><a href="#What-Will-You-Need-to-Record-a-TV-show-from-your-PC" class="headerlink" title="What Will You Need to Record a TV show from your PC?"></a>What Will You Need to Record a TV show from your PC?</h2><p>Recording live TV from your computer is much less complicated than it may sound at first. You will still need the proper hardware and software in order to be able to connect your TV, Tivo game console, or any other source of video and your PC or laptop. Keep in mind that you’ll also need a sufficient amount of data storage space if you want to record entire movies or TV shows from your PC. OK, let’s dive into what you will need to record a TV show from your PC right now.</p><h3 id="1-HD-PVR-or-Capture-Card"><a href="#1-HD-PVR-or-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="1. HD-PVR or Capture Card"></a>1. HD-PVR or Capture Card</h3><p>These two components are the essential part of the setup you’ll need to record live TV on your PC. Although they basically do the same thing, which is to enable you to transfer the video or TV signal to the computer you are using to record the footage, there are some considerable differences between these two devices. To help you understand it, we have made a detailed explanation below based on our research. So you can choose the Capture Card or HD-PVR based on your situation correctly.</p><h4 id="Capture-Card"><a href="#Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="Capture Card"></a>Capture Card</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-card-recording-tv.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with Capture Card"                ></p><p>A capture card is a great choice for all PC users who don’t care too much about the quality of the footage they are recording. The device needs to be connected to a TV or a gaming console with component cables, while a free USB slot is needed in order to connect a capture card to your computer.</p><p>The price of capture cards usually varies from $50 for entry-level options to $150 for high-end devices, which makes it more affordable than its alternative, the HD-PVR. Capture cards often come equipped with its own video recording software. However, some of them don’t offer a video recording software capable of high performances, and for that reason, you must do a thorough research before you decide which capture card you want to buy. If you want to get an in-deep understanding of capture card, you can check this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Complete Introduction to Capture Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and find out more about the best capture cards that are currently available on the market.</p><h4 id="HD-PVR"><a href="#HD-PVR" class="headerlink" title="HD-PVR"></a>HD-PVR</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hd-pvr-tv-recording.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with HD PVR devices"                ></p><p>The more powerful, but more expensive option for recording live TV from a PC is called HD-PVR or High Definition Personal Video Recorder, a box-shaped device that enables you to create near perfect video recordings of your favorite TV shows. The average price of an HD-PVR is approximately $200, even though high-end models can be even more expensive.</p><p>Most HD-PVR models feature their own video recording software, so you won’t have to spend additional money on the software you need to record a TV show from on a PC. Even if you don’t have an HD-PVR with its own built-in video recording software, obtaining a program that will enable you to record videos from a PC shouldn’t be too hard to find.</p><h3 id="2-Component-Cables"><a href="#2-Component-Cables" class="headerlink" title="2. Component Cables"></a>2. Component Cables</h3><p>The trouble with component cables is that they often must be purchased separately since most HD-PVR or capture cards manufacturers don’t include all the cables users need to connect a device to a TV and a computer. In most cases, you’ll just need a set of RCA cables, with ordinary red, yellow and white plugs to connect the capture card or an HD-PVR device to a TV. A simple USB cable can be used to establish a connection between a PC and the device you intend to use to record a TV show or any other TV-based video content.</p><h3 id="3-Video-Recording-Software"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording Software"></a>3. Video Recording Software</h3><p>You don’t have to worry if you were unlucky enough to get a capture card or HD-PVR that doesn’t have a built-in video recording software because the video recording software you can use to record TV shows from a PC are fairly common and easy to come by. Furthermore, all recent versions of the Windows OS, up until Windows 7 also provide ways to record live TV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tv-with-windows-media-center.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with Windows Media Center"                ></p><p>The Windows Media Center is the key entertainment feature on Windows 7 that enables its users to record TV shows, schedule recording sessions and watch the recorded videos from desktop and laptop computers. However, the Windows Media Center is not on the list of built-in features on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, but the software can be easily purchased and downloaded from the Microsoft’s website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-dvr-xbox.jpg"                      alt="Windows 10 Game DVR to Record TV"                ></p><p>PC owners that have Windows 10 installed on their computers are probably better off using software like Xbox Game DVR, simply because downloading the Windows Media Center may prevent them from getting the system updates in the future. Please note that if you would like to record TV shows to DVDs, using the video recording software that enables you to record live TV from a computer may not be enough since you will need a DVD recording software as well as a PC that has a DVD burner.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out more Free Screen Recorders on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you are finding a powerful software which allows to record and edit your video footage, we recommend you try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>With Filmora, you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record the screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the webcam, audio, and voiceover together in customizable video quality in FastJPG.

Key Features of Active Presenter"></a>Part 1. Key Features of Active Presenter</h2><p>Active Presenter is a popular tutorial and software simulation screen recorder that is known for its key features. It offers many of the same capabilities as a standard screen recorder, allowing users to record any type of video.</p><p>Recording – Recording allows you to capture video from your screen and webcam at the same time or independently, and audio from your system or an external microphone. Voice-overs and audio narration can also be added.</p><p>Editing – Active Presenter’s video and audio editor allows basic editing, such as cutting, copying, pasting and deleting. Complex modifications can also be made to audio and video clips - users can insert clips, speed up or slow down videos, blur items or apply green screen effects to them.</p><p>Software Simulation – Apart from recording regular video, you can record software simulation. In software simulation, you get a series of slides instead of a video. These slides can be regular slides or video slides. In video slides, your scrolling actions and drag-and-drop actions are recorded with full-motion recording. Besides, the application creates smart annotations, indicates mouse cursor path as well as mouse clicks and keystrokes on the slides. Moreover, you can add feedback messages and record narration for the software simulation project.</p><p>Interactive Quizzes – You can create engaging and interactive quizzes on Active Presenter. You have to select the question slides, add interactive actions and events that users can performance for engagement. You can also set score, time limit, and number of maximum attempts, pass and fail conditions and much more.</p><p>Export To HTML – You can export your software simulations and quizzes to HTML5 so that the users can access them online. The design is responsive and hence, it can run on any web browser on any device.</p><p>Versatile Export Options – Various export options are available, allowing you to export your video in multiple file formats including MP4, AVI, WMV, and MKV. You can also customize the frame rate, video quality, keyframe parameters, and other settings to decrease the output file size.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-Active-Presenter"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-Active-Presenter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives. Education and promotion are the most common reason to produce a webinar, so here are a few ideas that can help you choose the subject of your first webinar:</p><h4 id="1-Tutorial-Webinar"><a href="#1-Tutorial-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="1. Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task. You should do everything in your power to approach this task prepared since a simple mistake can ruin a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Define-Your-Goals"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience"><a href="#2-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing"><a href="#4-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing. Besides powerful tools for measuring metrics a good webinar software should also offer social media integrations, so you can reach even more people who might be interested in what your webinars have to offer.</p><h4 id="3-Interactivity"><a href="#3-Interactivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. Google + Hangouts</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. YouTube Live</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. Facebook Live</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam"><a href="#4-WebinarJam" class="headerlink" title="4. WebinarJam"></a>4. WebinarJam</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Pricing plans start at $39,99 per month billed annually</p><p>The web-based platform is designed to work seamlessly on any web-browser and any device, so its users won’t have to worry about the quality of their webinars. WebinarJam can be used for a wide array of different purposes including, Q&amp;As, presenting products or chatting with your fans. What’s more, as many as six co-presenters can speak in a single webinar, which makes WebinarJam an excellent option for roundtables and open debates about important topics.</p><p>This tool for the production of webinars enables you to capture high-definition footage, and it automatically records each session. WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar"><a href="#5-EverWebinar" class="headerlink" title="5. EverWebinar"></a>5. EverWebinar</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> On-demand Webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $41 per month, billed annually</p><p>WebinarJam and EverWebinar were developed by the same team, although the two platforms offer somewhat different options. The EverWebinar is designed to facilitate and simplify the process of rebroadcasting On-demand webinars. Small and up-and-coming brands that can profit from replaying webinars that were already recorded, will find EverWebinar’s services perfectly optimized for this task.</p><p>You can schedule a new rebroadcasting session effortlessly and simulate the look and feel of the original webinar while increasing the user engagement by making the videos available for a limited amount of time. This process is automated, so you can focus on chatting with the webinar’s participants or work on other projects while the On-demand webinar is in progress. EverWebinar lets you create three types of webinars, live, hybrid and automated, and you just have to select the option that best fits your current needs.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Password protected webinar rooms, great metrics features and interactive displays that present your products and services to the audience.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires a professional level of marketeering skills</p><h4 id="6-GoToWebinar"><a href="#6-GoToWebinar" class="headerlink" title="6. GoToWebinar"></a>6. GoToWebinar</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Large marketing teams and companies</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, Pricing starts at $89</p><p>The fact that 2.7 million webinars have been hosted on this platform in a single year, speaks a lot about the quality of the service GoToWebinar provides. This amazing webinar tool lets you create live events, produce interactive On-demand webinars or host events that include up to 5000 participants. Surveying the audience of a webinar and adding interactive polls or Q&amp;As is also an option you’ll have at your disposal if you decide to produce your webinars with GoToWebinar.</p><p>The online platform grants you access to advanced metrics so you can monitor how well your content is performing, which allows you to get leads and all other data you need to extend the reach of your webinars. GoToWebinar enables you to record your webinars and share them on YouTube or the GoToStage, an in-house video sharing platform that has millions of visitors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Equally efficient at creating live and On-Demand webinars, high-end analytics tools, great for raising the brand awareness</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The video files captured with GoToWebinar are stored on a computer, and they have to be uploaded manually on a desired video sharing platform, much more expensive than its competitors.</p><h4 id="7-Zoom"><a href="#7-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7. Zoom"></a>7. Zoom</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Educators, large companies, marketing teams</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> The Basic version is free, the Pro version costs $14,99 per month</p><p>This is a versatile webinar platform that is equally effective when utilized by eLearning content creators, entrepreneurs or marketers.

The number of meetings you can have in a single month is unlimited and the basic version of Zoom also offers video and web conferencing features, as well as group collaboration options.</p><p>If you would like to have admin controls or monitor the statistics of the webinars you’re producing, then the Pro version of Zoom is a much better choice. Regardless of the plan you purchase, the number of interactive participants will be limited to one hundred, but you’ll be able to have an audience that includes as many as 10.000 people, even though they won’t be able to interact with the content you’re presenting.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Affordable, and equipped with powerful tools for creating and recording a webinar</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Group meetings can’t last longer than 40 minutes, and the Zoom’s interface takes some time to get used to.</p><h4 id="8-Livestorm"><a href="#8-Livestorm" class="headerlink" title="8. Livestorm"></a>8. Livestorm</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Analytics oriented marketers</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing starts at $99 per month for Starter package</p><p>The greatest advantage Livestorm has over its competitors are the high-end analytics tools that provide the users with actionable insights.

Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt="Lollipop Screen Recorder"                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt="Lollipop Screen Recorder"                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window.

This feature allows you to record video via USB with the bundled Android Debug Bridge. To use this feature, your device should run on Android 4.4 or later.</p><p>Android Debug Bridge is a command-line utility that can control your Android Smartphone from a computer, copy files and add or remove apps. However, if you want to use ADB you’ll first need to go through the setup process, and even add it to the Windows System PATH.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB"><a href="#Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enabling the ADB"></a>Step 1: Enabling the ADB</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-screen-via-computer.jpg"                      alt="Record Android Screen via Computer"                ></p><p>Locate the SDK’s installation folder on your PC, and click on the ADB option in the Platform Tools menu.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t record video with older android devices.<br>In such cases you can use android SDK to mirror the device’s display and record it using a desktop screen-capture software. Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer. Here’s how to record your screen on Android without rooting.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo"><a href="#Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo"></a>Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo</h4><p>Start the process of setting up your screen recording session by downloading the MirrorGo Android recorder software for free from the manufacturer’s website. Launch the software and connect your Android Smartphone to the MirrorGo. You’ll be able to see the screen of your Android device on the PC’s screen. The software will synchronize all actions between two displays.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Record-the-Screen"><a href="#Step-2-Record-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Record the Screen"></a>Step 2: Record the Screen</h4><p>Locate the Android Recorder button, and click on it to commence the screen recording session. You can play mobile video games or create a detailed tutorial on how to use a certain Android app.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Complete-the-recording-and-access-the-video-file"><a href="#Step-3-Complete-the-recording-and-access-the-video-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Complete the recording and access the video file"></a>Step 3: Complete the recording and access the video file</h4><p>Click on the Android Recorder button to stop the session, and once the screen capturing process is finished, a pop window on your Smartphone’s screen will notify you that your video is saved and it will also show you the location on which the file was saved on your computer.</p><hr><h3 id="Method-3-Capture-Screen-on-Android-with-Capture-Card"><a href="#Method-3-Capture-Screen-on-Android-with-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Capture Screen on Android with Capture Card"></a>Method 3: Capture Screen on Android with Capture Card</h3><p>Capture Cards are devices that enable you to record screens on a wide range of different devices including X-box or PS4. Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-minipic-snapshot-scrutiny-plus-diverse-apps/"><u>[New] In 2024, MiniPic Snapshot Scrutiny + Diverse Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/1715859862335-in-2024-indispensable-sandbox-journeys-await/"><u>In 2024, Indispensable Sandbox Journeys Await!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-installing-vrecorder/"><u>[Updated] Essential Tips  Installing VRecorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-hasty-habits-presentation-file-recording-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Hasty Habits  Presentation File Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/free-online-video-capture-devices-analyzed-and-ranked/"><u>Free Online Video Capture Devices Analyzed & Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-a-complete-guide-of-screenrec-for-laptop/"><u>[New] A Complete Guide of ScreenRec for Laptop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-netflix-recording-mac-edition-6-essential-steps/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Netflix Recording  Mac Edition - 6 Essential Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/techniques-for-high-quality-in-game-recordings/"><u>Techniques for High-Quality In-Game Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-echovid-save-facebook-calls-for-2024/"><u>[New] EchoVid - Save Facebook Calls for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-maximize-view-count-responsibly-legal-avenues-to-a-million-fans/"><u>[Updated] Maximize View Count Responsibly  Legal Avenues to a Million Fans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-sony-xperia-5-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Sony Xperia 5 V? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-create-picsart-cartoon-in-simple-ways-for-2024/"><u>New How to Create Picsart Cartoon in Simple Ways for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-get-out-of-recovery-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Get Out of Recovery on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-10-of-the-best-disney-animated-shows/"><u>2024 Approved 10 of the Best Disney Animated Shows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-beyond-vlc-uncovering-hidden-streaming-gems/"><u>2024 Approved  Beyond VLC  Uncovering Hidden Streaming Gems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-hide-and-seek-top-5-for-secret-story-lovers/"><u>[Updated] Hide & Seek  Top 5 For Secret Story Lovers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-change-video-background-in-tiktok-3-ways-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Change Video Background in TikTok [3 Ways] for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

How to Record Video on PS4 with Capture Card"></a>Way 3. How to Record Video on PS4 with Capture Card</h2><p>If you do not want to install a PS4 emulator on your computer, you can purchase a capture card to connect your PS4 to your computer. Your computer screen will literally turn into a TV screen which you use to play on PS4. This does not make the gameplay lag, which is a common case when you use PS4 emulator to stream gameplay on PS4. In order to record your gameplay with Capture Card, you can use any screen recorder. In fact, there are some capture cards that have inbuilt screen recorder. Here are the steps to follow for gameplay recording PS4 using Capture card.</p><p>Step 1: Connect PS4, capture card and your computer through HDMI cable.</p><p>Step 2: The USB or data cable should go from Capture card to your computer. The PS4 should be connected to your TV.</p><p>Step 3: Turn on PS4 and go to Settings on your TV screen. From Settings, go to System&gt; System Information to check if PS4 software is updated. This is to ensure that what you see on your TV screen should also be on your laptop.</p><p>Step 4: On your computer, you can use any online screen recorder. If you have any inbuilt screen recorder that comes with your capture card, you can use the same. Start your gameplay and start recording on your computer.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record videos on PS4.

You’ll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app’s folder.

The frame rate, or “FPS” or frames per second, is a typical indication of a game’s playability. Around 30 is the typical best ps2 emulator android gaming pace.

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

Hence, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to SplitCam.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-all-encompassing-az-screenshot-tool-app-evaluations/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  All-Encompassing AZ Screenshot Tool  App Evaluations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-premium-solutions-for-remote-team-interaction/"><u>[New] In 2024, Premium Solutions for Remote Team Interaction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/best-ways-to-record-and-save-itunes-videos/"><u>Best Ways to Record and Save iTunes Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/exploring-roleplayings-boundaries-rogues-and-roguities-for-2024/"><u>Exploring Roleplaying's Boundaries  Rogues & Roguities for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-direct-directions-simple-techniques-for-laptop-screening-dell/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Direct Directions  Simple Techniques for Laptop Screening (Dell)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-pinnacle-playtime-the-greatest-action-adventure-game-lineup-ever/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Pinnacle Playtime  The Greatest Action-Adventure Game Lineup Ever</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-of-ios-solutions-to-play-your-favorite-psp-games/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate List of iOS Solutions to Play Your Favorite PSP Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-guide-to-recording-tv-screens-with-ease-and-precision/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Guide to Recording TV Screens with Ease and Precision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-checklist-for-mastering-bandicam-in-the-new-year/"><u>The Ultimate Checklist for Mastering Bandicam in the New Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-5-web-based-screening-sessions/"><u>2024 Approved  Prime 5 Web-Based Screening Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/strategic-planning-of-podcast-drop-times-for-2024/"><u>Strategic Planning of Podcast Drop Times for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-oneplus-nord-n30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fake Snapchat Location without Jailbreak On OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-the-security-questions-of-your-apple-id-on-your-apple-iphone-15-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Reset the Security Questions of Your Apple ID On Your Apple iPhone 15</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-soundscape-inclusions-of-brass-ensemble-noises-for-2024/"><u>Updated Exploring Soundscape Inclusions of Brass Ensemble Noises for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-frp-hijacker-by-hagard-download-and-bypass-your-motorola-moto-g24-frp-locks-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, FRP Hijacker by Hagard Download and Bypass your Motorola Moto G24 FRP Locks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-verify-your-youtube-account-a-simple-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Verify Your YouTube Account - a Simple Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-capture-movies-with-ease-cross-platform-techniques-and-tips/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Capture Movies with Ease  Cross-Platform Techniques & Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/acclaimed-encoder-technology-in-broadcast-systems-for-2024/"><u>Acclaimed Encoder Technology in Broadcast Systems for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/add-fantastic-backgrounds-for-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>Add Fantastic Backgrounds for YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-catch-the-regional-located-pokemon-for-vivo-y100a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Vivo Y100A | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Because of this, it becomes imperative to ensure that anything that the meeting attendees see looks decent and professional. One of the things that most people get conscious about during a video call is the background.</p><p>Many times, the walls of the rooms the organizer and&#x2F;or the invitees are using during the session might not be well-maintained. This is the main reason why everyone using the app must learn <strong>how to blur the background in Teams</strong>.</p><p>With that said, the following sections explain <strong>how to blur the background in Microsoft Teams</strong> on a computer, cellphone, and tablet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Blur Background on Teams on a MacBook Pro Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Blur Background in Teams Mobile App Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Blur Video Background on Teams Recorded Video?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-on-Teams-on-a-Windows-Laptop-Before-or-During-a-Video-Call"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-on-Teams-on-a-Windows-Laptop-Before-or-During-a-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call?"></a>Part 1: How to Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call?</h2><p>Microsoft Teams allows you to blur the background of the webcam footage before you start or join a video call, during an ongoing session. The methods of getting this done on the laptop computers are explained below in detail.</p><p>The following sections explain <strong>how to blur the background on Teams</strong> both before and during a video call while working on a Windows laptop. The step-by-step instructions are given below:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Blur-Background-on-Teams-Before-Video-Call"><a href="#Method-1-Blur-Background-on-Teams-Before-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call"></a>Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call</h3><p>If you have a meeting scheduled at a particular time but don’t know what to do with that homely background that wouldn’t go with the professional ambiance, luckily Microsoft Teams lets you blur it quite conveniently. The process is described as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Initiate a New Meeting Session</strong></p><p>Launch Microsoft Teams, and make sure that the <strong>Chat</strong> icon is selected in the left pane. From the top of the <strong>Chat</strong> pane, click the <strong>New Meeting</strong> (<strong>Camcorder</strong>) icon, and click <strong>Start meeting</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams.jpg"                      alt="Start Microsoft Teams video call on Windows laptop"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Check the Devices</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Meeting with</strong> box, make sure that the <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> switches present under the preview screen are enabled. Turn them on if they’re disabled. Next, click the <strong>Background effects</strong> (<strong>Person</strong>) icon from under the preview screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-blur-background-option.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Teams background blur"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Blur the Background before video call starts</strong></p><p>From the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane that appears next, and click to select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile. After this, you can safely click the <strong>Join now</strong> button to start a Teams video meeting with the blurred background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-video-background-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Teams background blur"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While using other operating systems&#x2F;laptops like Linux, Chromebook, etc., the process of blurring the background before a video call is identical. This means all you need to do is, initiate a new video meeting, click the <strong>Background effects</strong> (<strong>Person</strong>) icon from under the preview screen, and select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile before clicking the <strong>Join now</strong> button.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Blur-Background-on-Teams-During-Video-Call"><a href="#Method-2-Blur-Background-on-Teams-During-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Blur Background on Teams During Video Call"></a>Method 2: Blur Background on Teams During Video Call</h3><p>If you started or joined a Teams meeting without blurring the background, and want to do so during an ongoing call, you can follow the instructions given below to learn <strong>how to blur background in Teams</strong> while in a virtual conference session:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Background settings Pane</strong></p><p>During an ongoing video call, click <strong>More actions</strong> from the upper-right area of the meeting window, and click <strong>Apply background effects</strong> from the menu that comes down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-background-effects-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="blur background during Microsoft Teams"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Blur Background during the video call</strong></p><p>When the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane opens on the right of the window, click to select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Save the Changes</strong></p><p>From the bottom of the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane, click <strong>Apply</strong> to blur the background. Optionally, you can click <strong>Preview</strong> to see how the screen would look upon blurring, and apply the changes only when you are satisfied with the output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-microsoft-teams-video-background-during-meeting.jpg"                      alt="blur background during Microsoft Teams"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-Background-on-Teams-on-a-MacBook-Pro-Before-or-During-a-Video-Call"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-Background-on-Teams-on-a-MacBook-Pro-Before-or-During-a-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur Background on Teams on a MacBook Pro Before or During a Video Call?"></a>Part 2: How to Blur Background on Teams on a MacBook Pro Before or During a Video Call?</h2><p>As it is with Windows laptops, even MacBooks allow you to blur the background both before and during a video call.

If you’re using the Android phone or tablet, you may not blur the background on Teams video call. You can learn <strong>how to blur the background in Microsoft Teams</strong> while using an iOS device (iPhone X is used here for illustration) by following the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Start a New Meeting</strong></p><p>Launch Microsoft Teams on your iPhone or iPad, ensure that the <strong>Chat</strong> icon is selected from the bottom of the interface, tap the <strong>Instant meeting</strong> (<strong>Camcorder</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the screen, and tap <strong>Start meeting</strong> from the bottom of the box that appears next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams-iphone.jpg"                      alt="start Microsoft Teams  call on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get to the Background Effects Screen</strong></p><p>On the next screen, tap to enable both <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> functions from the bottom, tap the <strong>More actions</strong> icon, and then tap <strong>Background effects</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-iphone-background-effects.jpg"                      alt="blur Microsoft Teams  background on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Blur the Background</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Select background</strong> screen, tap <strong>Blur</strong> from the options available in the box at the bottom, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner to apply the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-teams-video-call-background-iphone.jpg"                      alt="blur Microsoft Teams  background on iPhone"                ></p><h2 id="FAQs-about-Blur-Teams-Meeting-Background"><a href="#FAQs-about-Blur-Teams-Meeting-Background" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background"></a>FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why can’t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?</strong></p><p><strong>A1)</strong> If you’re unable to see the ‘Blur’ tile or the ‘Background settings’ option altogether, probably your PC doesn’t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.</p><p>On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can.

But it can record only webcam videos and hence, this makes the application less versatile for different purposes. You cannot record from multiple video sources such as you cannot record screen and webcam together. That is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to MyCam.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-in-depth-review-free2x-webcam-capturing-software/"><u>2024 Approved  In-Depth Review  Free2X Webcam Capturing Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-precision-recording-of-console-games-on-your-pc/"><u>In 2024, Precision Recording of Console Games on Your PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-superior-zero-price-switch-emulators/"><u>2024 Approved  Superior Zero Price Switch Emulators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/essential-leisure-ideal-screen-time-solutions/"><u>Essential Leisure  Ideal Screen-Time Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-take-full-page-screen-images/"><u>[Updated] Take Full-Page Screen Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/capture-your-gaming-adventures-with-steam/"><u>Capture Your Gaming Adventures with Steam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-presence-online-capture-high-definition-webcam-footage-in-vlc/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your Presence Online  Capture High-Definition Webcam Footage in VLC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-the-art-of-facebook-live-recording/"><u>In 2024, Perfecting the Art of Facebook Live Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-embedding-youtube-videos-in-insta-stories/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Embedding YouTube Videos in Insta Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-voice-of-action-crafting-moving-screenplay-conversations/"><u>[Updated] The Voice of Action  Crafting Moving Screenplay Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-from-no-followers-to-a-million-top-15-tricks-to-become-an-instagram-phenomenon-for-2024/"><u>[New] From No Followers to a Million  Top 15 Tricks to Become an Instagram Phenomenon for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/mastering-your-mac-a-complete-guide-to-leveraging-preview-features-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Your Mac  A Complete Guide to Leveraging Preview Features for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-fine-tuning-your-obs-live-feeds-for-facebook-audience/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Fine-Tuning Your OBS Live Feeds for Facebook Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-high-end-broadcast-decision-pmix-vs-wirecast-for-professionals/"><u>[New] High-End Broadcast Decision  PMix Vs.
